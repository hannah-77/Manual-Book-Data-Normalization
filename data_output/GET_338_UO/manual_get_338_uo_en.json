GET 338 UO STERILISATOR ELECTRIC LINE DIAGRAM Chapter 12: Care and Maintenance 12.1 Buyer is not allowed to open or unpack the contents in the sterilizer. Any maintenance or renewal must be carried out by a trained and professional authorized person from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. Maintenance must be done with original components from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. 12.2 Please pull out the power supply plug when power electricity will be turned off. If this sterilizer is not used for a long period of time, please unplug the power supply from the power source, then put this sterilizer in a shady, cool and dry place. 12.3 Sterilizers should be maintained and cleaned regularly. How to clean the Elitech Sterilizer a. First of all the power cord must be disconnected from the power b. Prepare a bucket and mix clean water and cleaning agents (soap) liquid or neutral detergent) in the right ratio c. Dip a sponge into the bucket and rub it on the outer surface and the interior of the Sterilizer room and its instrument rack d. Dip the cloth in a bucket of clean water without cleaning agents then rub evenly throughout the sterilizer to remove foam and soap residue e. Use a dry and clean cloth to dry completely The sterilizer is completely dry and clean Additional Chapter In practice, there is no special officer responsible for the decontamination action, all group members play a role in the sterilization and disinfection process. In the public health department, the implementing officers usually consist of: Health supervisors, public health nurses, assistant nurses, midwives and public health doctors. In the surgical department, the group members may consist of general practitioners, room nurses, room heads, secretaries and receptionists. Routine tasks such as operating the Elitech Sterilizer can be left to someone else. In view of the above, it is necessary to provide the book \"Instructions for Use of Sterilizers\" and if needed we can provide the book \"Practical Instructions for Sterilizing Instruments with Elitech Sterilizers and Control of Cross Infections\". First of all, it must be understood the meaning and difference of the terms decontamination, disinfection and sterilization. The degree of decontamination desired is determined by the risk posed by the instrument. Decontamination: A general term that describes the method of washing, disinfection and sterilization to remove germs attached to medical equipment. Disinfection: A way to kill vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungi but not to kill Sterilization: A way to kill or destroy all microorganisms and spores attached to medical equipment. Often there is a misinterpretation of the term above, such as sterilizing with boiling hot water where this method does not kill all spores, viruses and Pre-cleaning is an important part of the decontamination process; if the instrument is not cleaned and rinsed first, blood and other debris will clot and adhere firmly to the instrument. The attached organisms will prolong the decontamination or sterilization process Elitech Sterilizing Cupboard/sterilisator brings new innovations in the medical world, in terms of Sterilizing medical equipment. With simple technology we made a breakthrough in the field of sterilization of medical equipment. By applying very high concentrations of ozone gas for sterilization and very high intensity UVC rays. Elitech Sterilisator fills the need for a sterilizer that is practical, economical, small and safe. Practical:  No special knowledge required  No need for supervision  No need for special care  Simple sterilization  Almost all equipment can be sterilized with this tool  Cloth, gauze, cotton can also be sterilized with this tool.  With a special wrapping, the instrument is kept sterile for one  Increase mobility for doctors and midwives Economical:  Low price  Practical maintenance  The addition of tools other than wrapping is not required  Smallest electricity consumption  The smallest electricity consumption means the lowest operating  Dimensions GET 338 UO = 435 width x 375 in x 450 height(mm) ",
