If the arm is pinched during measurement, it may cause acute internal bleeding or inaccurate measurement results. Measurement Limit For different patient conditions, oscillometric measurements have certain limitations. Measurement is looking for a regular pulse of arterial pressure. In those circumstances when the patient's condition makes it difficult to detect, the measurement becomes unreliable and the measurement time increases. Users should be aware that the following conditions may interfere with measurements, making measurements unreliable or taking longer to derive. In some cases, the patient's condition makes measurement impossible. Patient Movement Measurements are unreliable or cannot be performed if the patient is moving, shivering or having seizures. This movement can interfere with pulse detection of arterial pressure. In addition, the measurement time will be extended. Heart arrhythmia Measurements are not reliable and may not be possible if the patient's cardiac arrhythmia has caused an irregular heartbeat. Thus, the measurement time will be extended. heart-lung machine Measurements would not be possible if the patient was connected to a heart-lung machine. Pressure Change Measurements will be unreliable and impossible if the patient's blood pressure changes rapidly over a period of time during which the arterial pressure pulse is analyzed to obtain a measurement. Severe shock If the patient is in severe shock or hypothermia, measurement is unreliable because reduced peripheral blood flow will result in reduced arterial pulse. Extreme Heartbeat Measurements cannot be taken at a heart rate less than 30 bpm and greater than 250 bpm. Round Patient A thick layer of body fat will reduce measurement accuracy, because fat originating from arterial shock cannot access the cuff due to damping.

Adopt a comfortable sitting position, using your back and arms to support your body. 2. Place your elbows on the table, palms facing up and body relaxed. 3. The cuff is in line with your heart. 4. Feet flat on the floor, and do not cross your legs. Suggestion Try to take your blood pressure at the same time each day with the same arm and the same pose for consistency. The high and low position of the cuff will cause changes in the measurement results. Do not touch the sphygmomanometer, cuff, and throat during measurement. Measurements should be taken in a quiet and relaxed place. Keep still 4~5 minutes before measurement. Do not talk or move during the measurement. Relax the body, do not allow muscle activity. Wait 4~5 minutes between measurements. Do not use precision instruments near the sphygmomanometer. When repeatedly measuring, an accurate blood pressure value may not be measured due to congestion in the arm. Please measure after the blood flow is smooth. Repeated measurements for long periods of time, limb rubbing against the cuff may be accompanied by purpura, ischemia, and nerve damage. When measuring the patient, it is necessary to frequently check the color, warmth and sensitivity of the distal extremity. Once abnormalities are observed, place the cuff in another position or stop the blood pressure measurement immediately. Please use the device in an environment with suitable temperature and humidity (see Chapter 19), otherwise it will cause measurement error. Do not twist or wrap the airway tube. This can cause constant pressure on the cuff which can block blood flow and cause serious damage to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the injured area, which will cause more serious damage to the area. Do not use the cuff in areas where the treatment is in a vein or arteriovenous junction. This can cause a temporary blockage of blood flow and cause injury to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the mastectomy side. When using the cuff to apply pressure, some bodily functions may be temporarily weakened. Do not use medical electrical measuring equipment at the appropriate arm position.

Chapter 12 SpO2 Measurement Function Precautions during SpO2 Measurement: ️ Make sure the nails cover the light. The probe cable should be on the back of the hand. Improper placement of the probe or improper contact with the test site will affect the measurement. ️ The SpO2 value is always displayed in a fixed place. ️ The test site must not use external coloring agents (such as nail polish, dyes or colored skin care products, etc.), otherwise it will affect the measurement. ️ Fingers that are too cold or too thin may affect the measurement accuracy, please insert thicker fingers such as thumb or middle finger deep enough into the probe. ️ The SpO2 probe is suitable for both children and adults (not suitable for infants and newborns). The device may not apply to all patients. If you cannot achieve a stable reading, discontinue use. ️ Data averaging and signal processing will delay the SpO2 display and data value transmission. The measurement data update time is less than 30 seconds, when the signal attenuation, weak perfusion or other interference appears, it will result in an increase in the dynamic data average time, which depends on the PR value. ️ The PLETH waveform is not normalized, which is used as an indicator of signal incompleteness. So that the accuracy of the measured value can decrease if the waveform tends to be not smooth and stable. When the waveform tends to be smooth and stable, the reading is the optimal value, and the current waveform is the most standard. ️ The temperature of the contact surface of the device with the body is less than 41℃, and this temperature value is measured by a temperature measuring device. ️ The device does not provide an alarm function that exceeds the limit, so it cannot be used where the function is required. ️ The SpO2 probe is calibrated before it leaves the factory. No need to calibrate during maintenance. ️ The SpO2 probe is calibrated to show functional oxygen saturation. ️ The SpO2 probe and photoelectric receiving tube should be arranged so that the subject's arterioles are positioned in between. Make sure the optical path is free of optical obstructions such as rubber cloth, to avoid inaccurate measurements. ️ Since measurements are based on arteriolar pulses, substantial pulsed blood flow from the subject is required. For subjects with a weak pulse due to shock, low ambient/body temperature, heavy bleeding, or use of vascular contracting drugs, the SpO2 (PLETH) waveform will decrease. In this case, the measurement will be more sensitive to interference. ️ The accuracy of the readings under weak perfusion was verified using signals from the patient simulator. SpO2 and pulse rate values vary within the measurement range due to various weak signal conditions and are compared with the actual SpO2 and pulse rate values of the known input signal. ️ Claims of SpO2 accuracy must be supported by clinical research measurements spanning the entire spectrum. By artificially inducing to different levels of stable oxygen, making it in the range of 70% 100% SpO2. Use secondary standard SpO2 measuring equipment for comparison to collect SpO2 values along with the product being tested, create paired data groups for accuracy analysis. ️ The clinical report recorded data on 12 healthy volunteers, including 6 women and 6 men. The age of the volunteers ranged from 21 to 29 years. Skin color is distributed from dark to light, including 3 dark blacks, 2 medium blacks, 5 light skins, 2 whites. ️ When using the device, keep it away from instruments that can generate strong electric or magnetic fields. Using the device in an unsuitable environment may cause interference to nearby radio equipment or affect its operation. ️ If necessary, please go to our company's official website to download a list of SpO2 probes and extension cables that can be used with this device. ️ Check if the SpO2 probe wire is in normal condition before measuring. After unplugging the SpO2 probe from the socket, the \"SpO2%\" and \"bmp\" on the screen will disappear. ️ Do not use the SpO2 probe after the package or probe has been found to be damaged. Instead, you must return it to the vendor. ️ The included SpO2 probe is only suitable for use with this device. This device can only use the SpO2 probe described in this manual. It is the operator's responsibility to check the compatibility of the SpO2 device and probe (and extension cord) prior to use. Incompatible accessories may result in decreased device performance or cause injury to the patient. ️ SpO2 probe is a medical product that can be used repeatedly. ️ The measured values may appear normal in the testee who has anemia or dysfunctional hemoglobin (such as carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), methaemoglobin (MetHb) and sulfhaemoglobin (SuHb)), but the testee may appear hypoxic, it is advisable to carry out further assessment according to the situation and clinical symptoms. ️ Pulse oxygen has only reference significance for anemia and toxic hypoxia, because some patients with severe anemia still show better pulse oxygen measurements. ️ Measurement accuracy may be affected by interference with electrosurgery equipment. SpO2 probe to the extremity with an arterial catheter or receive intravenous injection. Do not take the SpO2 measurement and the NIBP measurement on the same leg at the same time, as obstruction of blood flow during NIBP measurement can affect the SpO2 reading. Excessive movement (active or passive) of the subject or strenuous activity may affect measurement Excessive ambient light may affect the measurement results, such as surgical light (especially xenon light sources), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lamps, infrared heaters and direct sunlight, etc. To prevent interference from ambient light, be sure to position the probe properly and cover the probe with an opaque material. Measured values may not be accurate during defibrillation and for a short time after defibrillation, because the SpO2 probe does not have a defibrillation hold function. People who are allergic to silicone, PVC, TPU, TPE or ABS cannot use this device. For some special patients, the examination should be more careful in the measurement section. The probe cannot be cut in edema and soft tissue. Do not look directly at the luminescent components when the device is turned on (infrared light is not visible), even if it is for maintenance purposes, or it may be bad for the eyes. Feelings of discomfort or pain may occur with continuous use of the SpO2 probe, especially for patients with microcirculation barriers. It is recommended that measurements are not taken in the same position for more than 2 hours. Continuous and prolonged measurement can increase the risk of undesirable changes in skin characteristics, such as extreme sensitivity, redness, blistering or pressing necrosis, especially for neonates or patients with impaired perfusion and changes or immature skin shape. Particular attention should be paid to checking the position of the probe placement according to changes in skin quality, correct optical alignment, and method of insertion. Check the attachment position periodically and change it as the leather quality deteriorates. More frequent examinations may be required due to differences in the patient's condition. Some functional test models or patient simulators can measure the accuracy of devices that reproduce calibration curves, but cannot be used to evaluate the accuracy of these devices. refer to the relevant medical literature for detailed clinical limitations and contraindications, This device is not used for medicinal purposes. Do not use the SpO2 probe during MRI and CT scans, as the induced current may cause burns. When the device is ON, if the power is cut off for more than 30 seconds, the SpO2 probe does not require operation after the power is restored, after the device is turned on, make sure the SpO2 probe can be used normally. probe can be used before/after exercise, but is not recommended for use during exercise. Chapter 13 Method of Measurement of SpO2 1) Attach the SpO2 probe to the right place of the patient's finger as shown below.
