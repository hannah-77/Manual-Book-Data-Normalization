The most important thing is to check whether the wheelchair bolts are loose or not. If it is loose, the bolt must be tightened immediately. In normal use of a wheelchair, once every three months we have to do a check to make sure that all the parts are good. Make sure the bolts on the wheelchair are installed properly (especially the rear axle fixing nut). If some loose bolts are found, they must be tightened immediately because it concerns patient safety.  Wheelchairs should be wiped with a dry cloth immediately if they get wet in the rain during use. Under normal use, we should always use a soft dry cloth to clean the wheelchair.  Check wheelchair flexibility and always lubricate every joint and axle to prevent corrosion. If the wheelchair is not checked regularly it will interfere with flexibility and mobility, and hinder patient activity.  The maximum load limit for wheelchairs is 100 kg, do not give a load that exceeds the specified load.
