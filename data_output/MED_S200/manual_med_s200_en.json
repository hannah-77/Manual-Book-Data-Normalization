Trouble Possible Reason Solution The simulator produces consistent and repetitive simulation signal, in ideal condition, the difference between two continuous When the measurements is no more than simulator is set 2mmHg. So the difference here is to a fixed BP mainly caused by the NIBP value, results monitor. measured by According to relative standards, the same average deviation between Having some difference is 1 monitor for checking system and compare normal and acceptable. several times system should be less than are different, ±5mmHg, and standard deviation and sometimes should be less than 8mmHg. So 5, the difference 6 even 10mmHg in a test is is up to normal, neither the monitor nor 5mmHg. the simulator has problems. Some monitors are more repeatable than others, and repeatability is one measure of the overall quality of the monitor. Some monitors were designed to give readings close to those obtained by the ascultatory method of blood When the pressure determination. Other simulator is set monitors have been to a fixed BP designed to agree with Invasive value, the Blood Pressure readings. It is well Different monitors were results known that designed to agree with measured by Invasive and Ascultatory BP different reference data, different readings on the same subject can neither the monitor nor the monitors are be quite simulator is broken, or gives different, and different. Therefore it is not fault data. sometimes the surprising that automated difference is Oscillometric NIBP very obvious. monitors using Invasive readings as a reference would give different than a monitor based on Ascultatory readings. 1.
