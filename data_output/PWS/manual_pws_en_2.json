Patient Warmer System Note 2: These guidelines may not apply in all cases, as electromagnetic propagation is influenced by absorption and reflection from buildings, objects, and human bodies. a. Fixed transmitting stations such as wireless (cellular/cordless) phones and ground mobile radio base stations, amateur radio, AM (amplitude modulation) and FM (frequency modulation) radio broadcasts, and television broadcasts all cannot accurately predict their field strength theoretically. To evaluate the electromagnetic environment of fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic field survey should be considered. If the field strength measured at the location of devices exceeds the RF compliance levels for the applications mentioned above, observations of devices should be conducted to verify their proper operation. If abnormal performance is observed, corrective measures may be necessary, such as realigning or relocating devices. b. For the entire frequency range of 150 kHz to 80 MHz, the field strength should be less than 3 V/m. Recommended isolation distance between portable and mobile RF communication equipment and devices The device is expected to be used in an electromagnetic environment with controlled radiation RF interference.Based on the maximum output power of the communication equipment, purchasers or users of this device can prevent electromagnetic interference by following the recommended minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communication devices (transmitters) and devices.

Select the appropriate model and specification of the warming blanket based on the patient type and surgical requirements.The warming blanket comes in two types: cover blanket denoted by \"U\", placed over the patient, and mat blanket denoted by \"D\", positioned under the patient. 2. Open the packaging and take out the blanket.Spread the blanket flat according to the diagram on the label,ensuring it is flat without any wrinkles,and make sure the light-colored non-woven fabric faces the patient.During usage, ensure it comes in contact with the non-surgical area of the patient's body. For some models,it can be wrapped around the user as needed for clinical use to improve insulation. Pay attention not to compress the air duct when wrapping. 3. Insert the wind outlet of the device into the air inlet of the blanket, ensuring it is securely fixed. Use Velcro or straps to secure the connection of the air duct, preventing it from coming loose. Keep the air duct flat and straight, ideally positioning the wind outlet connection vertically with the inner end line of the blanket and placing it centrally and horizontally to enhance the warming effect. 4. Start the inflatable warming unit and preheat for 3-10 minutes to stabilize the temperature of the air outlet. 5. After preheating, cover the patient with the cover blanket or place the mat blanket under the patient. Secure the warming blanket to the operating table or bed edges using adhesive strips or non-woven fabric strips to prevent it from moving or slipping. 6. Straighten and flatten all the inflation channels of the warming blanket during use, allowing the non-woven fabric on the four sides to naturally hang down. 7. Adjust the output temperature and airflow of the inflatable warming unit as needed. The warm air delivered by the warming unit will heat the warming 8. Continuously monitor the patient's temperature for temperature regulation. Adjust as necessary if overheating or undercooling is observed. 9. After use, remove the warming blanket and dispose of it as medical waste.  Important Notes, Warnings, and Instructions 1. Must be operated or used under the guidance of professional medical personnel. Patient Warmer System 2. The outermost welding line should be used as the outer boundary of the heating area of the warming blanket to distinguish between heated and non-heated 3. To achieve better air warming effects, it is recommended to use the warming blanket of each model and specification according to the recommended wind speed level in the table. 4. Temperature deviations in areas other than the core area of the application site of warming blankets of each model and specification are not guaranteed. 5. When in use, securely connect the warming blanket to the device’s duct, ensure the blanket is laid flat, do not reverse the blanket, with the light-colored breathable side facing the patient, switching sides may cause inability to warm 6. Do not use torn or damaged warming blankets, avoid sharp objects piercing them during use to prevent affecting their effectiveness. 7. Do not use blankets to transfer or move patients as it may result in the patient getting injured. 8. If the patient cannot undergo mechanical ventilation, do not cover the patient's head or airway with the warming blanket. 9. Do not place heavy or excessive objects above the blanket,including surgical drapes,pillows,or blankets; keep the air duct of the blanket clear to prevent airway blockage and affect warming effects. 10. The product is for single-use only; dispose of it as required by hospitals or environmental departments after use.  Contraindications : None  Manual Revision Date : May 31, 2024  Production Date : Refer to the packaging seal  Expiry Date ; Store under specified conditions; shelf life of 3 years  Storage Conditions : The packaged product should be stored in a clean environment with relative humidity not exceeding 80%, free from corrosive gases, cool, dry, well-ventilated  Explanation of Tags Do not reuse Keep dry Avoid sunlight XII.
