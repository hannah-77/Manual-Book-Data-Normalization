Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. aField strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment dueto fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the [MSP-01] is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the [MSP-01] should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as re-orienting or relocating the [MSP-01]. bOver the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than [3] V/m. Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the [MSP-01] The [MSP-01] is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled. The customer or the user of the [MSP-01] can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment (transmitters) and the [MSP-01] as recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communications equipment. Separation distance according to frequency of Rated maximum transmitter(m). output power of 800M~2.5G 150k~80MHz 80M~800MHz transmitter (W) Hz d 1.2 P d 1.2 P d  2 . 3 P 0.01 0.12 0.12 0.23 0.1 0.38 0.38 0.73 1 1.2 1.2 2.3 10 3.8 3.8 7.3 100 12 12 23 For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the recommended separation distanced in metres (m) can be estimated using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where Pis the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) according to the transmitter manufacturer. NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the separation distance for the higher frequency range applies. NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations.
