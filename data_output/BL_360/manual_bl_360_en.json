The 8 blue LED light bars distributed in the box constitute the upper and lower parts of the blue light irradiation light source, and the upper and lower parts of the box constitute an upper light source room and a lower light source room respectively. The upper light source chamber can be pulled up by the handle, and the gas spring forms an effective fixed support structure. The net cover of the crib adopts a permeable net structure, which is conducive to the blue light irradiation treatment of the lower part. When the LED lights in the upper and lower light source rooms emit blue light for treatment, they also generate a certain amount of heat radiation, so that the air temperature in the box gradually rises to the environmental temperature required for treatment. The LED lamp driving circuit and the fan cooling system are located in the lower part of the base. The cooling system takes away the excess heat of the system through the air duct connected by the upper and lower light source chambers, so that the system maintains the treatment environment temperature relatively stable. The control circuit is located inside the operation panel. Medical staff select the appropriate irradiation mode and timing method according to clinical needs, and Manual Book Infant Phototherapy Unit BL-360 monitor the skin temperature according to the panel display, which can safely and effectively treat neonatal jaundice.
