When the unit is connected to the main supply, the battery will be recharged automatically. During the recharging course, the battery indicator flashes in the top right corner of the LCD screen. After the battery is fully recharged, the indicator stops flashing. Because of the capacity consumption during the storage and transport course, the battery capacity is not full when used for the first time. Battery recharge should be considered before the first use. When using a new battery, after the first charge is fully charged, it can be charged for another 20-30 minutes to reach full capacity. NOTE: The battery will automatically stop charging if you print an ECG report. Repeated undercharging of the battery will damage the battery and reduce battery life. 3) Replacement When the battery's useful life is over or foul smell and leakage are found, please contact the manufacturer or the local distributor for replacement. 1. Only qualified service engineers authorized by the manufacturer can open the battery compartment and replace the battery.
