NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the Infrared Thermometer is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the Infrared Thermometer should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the Infrared Thermometer.

The 1 m test distance is permitted by IEC 61000-4-3. a) For some services, only the uplink frequencies are included. b) The carrier shall be modulated using a 50 % duty cycle square wave signal. c) As an alternative to FM modulation, 50 % pulse modulation at 18 Hz may be used because while it does not represent actual modulation, it would be worst case. The MANUFACTURER should consider reducing the minimum separation distance, based on RISK MANAGEMENT, and using higher IMMUNITY TEST LEVELS that are appropriate for the reduced minimum separation distance. Minimum separation distances for higher IMMUNITY TEST LEVELS shall be calculated using the following equation: Where P is the maximum power in W, d is the minimum separation distance in m, and E is the IMMUNITY TEST LEVEL in V/m. ◼ Don’t near active HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT and the RF shielded room of an ME SYSTEM for magnetic resonance imaging, where the intensity of EM DISTURBANCES is high. ◼ Use of this equipment adjacent to or stacked with other equipment should be avoided because it could result in improper operation. If such use is necessary, this equipment and the other equipment Electrocardiograph should be observed to verify that they are operating ◼ Use of accessories, transducers and cables other than those specified or provided by the manufacturer of this equipment could result in increased electromagnetic emissions or decreased electromagnetic immunity of this equipment and result in improper operation.” ◼ Portable RF communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 30 cm (12 inches) to any part of the device including cables specified by the manufacturer. Otherwise, degradation of the performance of this equipment could result. ◼ Active medical devices are subject to special EMC precautions and they must be installed and used in accordance with these guidelines. Note： ◼ The EMISSIONS characteristics of this equipment make it suitable for use in industrial areas and hospitals (CISPR 11 class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 class B is normally required) this equipment might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to Electrocardiograph take mitigation measures, such as relocating or re- orienting the equipment. ◼ When the device is disturbed, the data measured may fluctuate, please measure repeatedly or in another environment to ensure its accuracy.
