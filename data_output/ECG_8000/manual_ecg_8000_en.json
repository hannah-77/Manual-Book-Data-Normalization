ECG-8000S Stress Analysis System Precautions Chapter 9 Precautions Do not operate the instrument on parts of human body with wounds and do not perform measurements on parts with wounds on the surface. 9.1 This device is not intended to act directly on the human heart. If this device is used with cardiac defibrillator or other electric stimulating devices at the same time, single- use electrode and ECG lead cables with defibrillation- proof function should be selected. It is better not to use this device with other electric stimulating devices at the same time. If it is necessary, there must be professional technician guiding on the scene, and the selected accessories should be designated by our company. The resistance of lead cable with defibrillation-proof function protection function is about 10KΩ. 9.2 When the electrocardiograph is used together with a high-frequency electrosurgical knife, the ECG electrode should be kept away from the contact of the electrosurgical knife to prevent burns and burning of the electrode wires caused by high-frequency sparks. ECG-8000S Stress Analysis System Precautions 9.3 When the electrocardiograph is used together with a defibrillator, the operator should avoid contact with the patient or the sickbed. The defibrillation electrode should not directly touch the ECG electrode to prevent sparks from burning the device and the patient. 9.4 Please do not use the electrocardiograph in the environment that is interfered by high-power device such as high-voltage cables, X-rays, ultrasonic machines and electrizer, away from emission sources such as mobile 9.5 When other devices are connected with this ECG instrument, they must be Type I devices which accord with IEC60601-1. Because the total amount of leakage current may hurt patients, the monitoring of leakage current is carried out and taken charge by connect devices. 9.6 Notes related to EMC The device complies with the safety standards for medical electrical equipment or system electromagnetic compatibility in IEC60601-1-2. Electromagnetic environments exceeding the IEC60601-1-2 standard may cause harmful interference to the device or prevent the device from performing its intended function or degrade ECG-8000S Stress Analysis System Precautions its performance. Therefore, if there is a phenomenon that does not match its function during use, be sure to confirm and eliminate adverse effects before continuing to use it. Corresponding precautions for this situation are given in this manual.  The device or system should not be used near or stacked with other devices. If it must be used near or stacked with other devices, it should be observed and verified that the device is working normally under the configuration it is using.  In addition to transducers and cables sold by the manufacturer of the device or system as spare parts for internal components, use of accessories and cables outside of the regulations may result in reduced muscle-building emitted by device or system and interference immunity.  Effect from radiated electromagnetic waves: The use of a mobile phone may affect the operation of the device. When installing medical electrical equipment, be sure to remind people around the device to turn off mobile phones and small radios ECG-8000S Stress Analysis System Precautions  Effect from shock and conduction electromagnetic High frequency noise from other equipment can enter the device through the AC socket. Please identify the source of noise, if possible, stop using the equipment. If the equipment can not be deactivated, use noise cancellation equipment or take other measures to reduce the impact.  Effect from static electricity: Static electricity in a dry environment(indoor) may affect the operation of the device, especially in winter. Before using the device, humidify the indoor air or discharge the static electricity from the cable and ECG record personnel.  Effect from thunder and lightning: If there is thunder and lightning nearby, it may cause a voltage surge in the device. If you are concerned about danger, pull the AC power plug and use the internal power supply. 9.7 Do not allow the patient and patient-connected lead cables and electrodes to come into contact with other conductor parts, including the earth or a hospital bed. ECG-8000S Stress Analysis System Precautions 9.8 Maintenance or repair to the device or accessory is not allowed during using. ",
