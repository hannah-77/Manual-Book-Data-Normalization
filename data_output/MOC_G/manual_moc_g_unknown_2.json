Instructions for use 1. Connect the power, plug the power line plug that is connected to AC220V power, turn on the power (Circuit Breaker) switch and the Green (PO) indicator light will light up, LCD Screen, Red indicator light indicates Low Oxygen is on. Figure 4 The indicator lights up when connected to mains 2. After 3 minutes of operation. Flow Meter must be adjusted to the required flow, Adjust the oxygen output flow properly according to demand (counterclockwise means increase LPM Flow Meter, clockwise means Decrease LPM Flow Meter, MOC-G 20 LPM is adjusted to 20L/min. Figure 5 Oxygen flow (L/min) 3. Then adjusts the PR Valve (Outlet Pressure) can be adjusted to the pressure regulating valve. The range used is between (0.14 Mpa – 0.4 Mpa). Indicator Digital Indicator Pressure O2 Analog Pressure O2 Knop Pressure O2 Figure 6 pressure knob (PR VALVE) 4. Wait for Unit Operation less more than 10 minutes.Oxygen purity is above 90% 5. .Oxygen purity indicator:Oxygen purity will rise to normal level within ten minutes of operation.When oxygen purity ≥ 85%,blue light is on (HO),when oxygen purity is <85%,red light is on (LO) 6. .Enter end of the hose to the outlet of the MOC-G oxygen unit, then apply oxygen. 7. When finished using, turn the switch to “OFF”, the axial fan, and the air dryer device will stop working after 60 Seconds. Please turn off the power (Circuit Breaker) switch 8. If there is intermittent use, please unplug the power plug. Unplug the power plug Figure 7 Mains Plug 9. Maintenance 1. When the power is off, clean the outside of the case with a soft damp towel, then wipe with a dry towel, once or twice a month. 2. Cleaning the main filter is an important step in the maintenance of cleaning the intake air filter, if Acc. Time : Accumulative Operating Time (Average usage time) shows 200 hours or if rarely used twice a month. Detailed steps: remove the intake air filter, clean with detergent and clean with clean water completely, get rid of extra water and dry naturally. Finally put it back after it dries. Damage: Do not operate the MOC-G unit without the filter installed, or when the filter is wet. Doing so may damage the MOC-G unit permanently. Figure 8 Main Filter 3. Clean the second filter (replace filter cotton) at Acc intervals. Time : Accumulative Operating Time (Average usage time) shows 900 hours or if rarely used twice a month, Open the side door, open the filter pipe body counterclockwise, remove the filter cloth, then clean with detergent, then clean with clean water completely , remove any extra water, and dry naturally, lastly plug it back in after it dries. Damage: Do not operate the MOC-G unit without the filter installed, or when the filter is wet. Doing so may damage the MOC-G unit permanently. Figure 9 Second Filter 4. If the user wants circuit diagrams, lists of critical components, details of maintenance and repair, we will provide data on all the repairable parts we can 10. Problem and solution No. Problem Cause Solution 1. There is no connection 1. Check that the switch, between the oxygen plug, power line are There is no operation generator circuit and the properly connected. after the power is mains 2. Replace the starting connected 2. The compressor capacitor 3. Replace the Compressor 3. Compressor is faulty 1. Fold outflow inside the 1. Connect hose again hose, no smooth intake No oxygen out or small 2. 2. Clogged filter, no smooth 2. Clean filter 1. Air controller can't work 1. Replace air control valve 2. Electrical control board can't 2. Replace electrical control 3. No exhaust sound Muffler is too noisy 1. Exhaust filter connection 1. Connect good connection 2. Have the exhaust 2. Exhaust filter broken 11.
