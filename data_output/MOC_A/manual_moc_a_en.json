Electromagnetic radiation Chapter 2 Introduction This instruction manual will introduce you to oxygen concentrators. Make sure that you read and understand this manual before operating the unit. Contact your medical equipment provider if you have any questions. For your safety, oxygen concentrators should be used as prescribed by your doctor. Oxygen causes rapid combustion. Do not smoke while the oxygen concentrator is operating, or when you are in close proximity to people who are on oxygen therapy. Keep within 5 feet (1.6m) of heat, objects or sources of ignition. Why Your Doctor Needs Supplemental Oxygen Today, many people suffer from heart, lung, and other respiratory ailments. Many people can use oxygen therapy. Your body needs a steady supply of oxygen to function properly. Doctor requires supplemental oxygen because you are not getting enough oxygen from the room air alone. Additional oxygen will increase the amount of oxygen in your body. Supplemental Oxygen is not an addictive substance. Your doctor may require a special flow of oxygen to improve symptoms such as headache, drowsiness, confusion, fatigue, or irritability. If these symptoms persist after you have started a supplemental oxygen program, consult your Chapter 3 Technical Specifications Model MOC - A Power Input AC 220V, 50 Hz, ±350W Oxygen Concentration 93% ±3% Flow Rate 1~5 liters per minute Noise Level 40 dB(A) Normal SPO2 Value 90~99% Alarm/ yellow indicator lights up if concentration Sound alarm and red indicator lights up if Abnormal machine condition Dimension 405(L) x 307(W) x 568(H) mm Weight 16,60 kg Temperature 18°C - 30°C Relative humidity 10% - 85% RH environment Pressure 700hpa - 1060hpa temperature -10°C - +55°C Relative humidity ≤ 95% environment Pressure 500hpa - 1060hpa Chapter 4 Unit Display Concentrator oxygen is the most reliable, efficient, and readily available source today. The oxygen concentrator is operated electrically. The unit separates oxygen from room air allowing high purity oxygen to be delivered through the oxygen outlet, although the concentrator filters oxygen in the room, it will not affect the normal amount of oxygen in your room. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the oxygen concentrator before operating. Before using this product, please make sure you have the following items: ",
    "1.3 Penjelasan Simbol": "symbols such as the following: NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, higher frequencies apply NOTE 2 This guide may not apply to all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects, and people. aField strengths from fixed generators, such as stations for radiotelephone (cellular or cordless) and mobile radio, amateur radio, AM and FM radio and TV cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF generators, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the field strength at the location where the Patient Monitor is used exceeds the RF compliance level, the Patient Monitor must be monitored to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is found, additional measurements may be required, such as changing orientation or moving the Patient Monitor. bThe frequency range is above 150 kHz to 80 MHz, the field strength must be less than 1 V/m (80 – 800 MHz) and 3 V/m (800 – 2500 MHz).

Exhaust Chapter 4 Unit Operation INSTALLING OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR 1. Position the unit near an electrical outlet in the room where you spend most of the Keep the oxygen concentrator at least 5 feet (1.6m) away from heat, flammable objects or sources of ignition. NOTES: Do not connect an electrical outlet through a branch outlet. No other equipment branches should be plugged into the socket. 2. Position your unit at least 6 inches (16 cm) from walls, curtains, or other objects that might prevent air flow in and out of your oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators must be located to avoid pollutants or vapors. 3. Replace the bacterial filter at least once a year. You cannot replace the bacterial filter yourself, contact a medical provider for a bacterial filter replacement. BEFORE OPERATING THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR 1. Before operating the unit, always check and ensure that the air filter (located on the back of the unit) is clean. How to clean this filter is discussed in a different chapter. 2. Attach the proper oxygen accessories to the oxygen outlet. Oxygen Tub Connector: a. Attach the oxygen outlet plug to the oxygen outlet. b. Attach the oxygen cylinder directly to the connector. Figure 2. Oxygen tub connector Connection of Oxygen Tubing with Humidifier: If your doctor has prescribed an oxygen humidifier as part of therapy, follow these a. Fill the humidifier bottle with distilled water. Don't spill. b. Attach and connect the hose from the nipple out to the humidifier bottle cap located on the top of the humidifier bottle tightly. Make sure the hose is strong and doesn't come off easily. c. Attach the oxygen cylinder directly to the humidifier bottle. Figure 3. Oxygen Tubing with Humidifier 3. Remove the cable from the cable tie strap completely and make sure the power button is in the “OFF” position. Insert the plug into the wall socket. The unit is double insulated to prevent electric shock Misuse of the power cord and plug can cause burns, fire or other electric shock hazard. Do not use the unit if the power cord is damaged. OPERATING THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR Oxygen causes rapid combustion. Do not smoke while operating oxygen concentrators, or when you are in close contact with people who are on oxygen therapy. Keep the oxygen concentrator at least 5 feet (1.6m) away from heat, objects or sources of ignition. Press the power button to the \"On\" position. When the unit is turned on, the power indicator light will come on, and the patient warning system is indicated by an indicator light and an alarm sound. NOTES: If the “Call Service” light is on and an alarm sound is heard but the unit does not operate, there is no power to the unit, contact your medical provider if necessary. The Oxygen Concentrator Device is a device that monitors the oxygen produced by your unit. When the unit is turned \"ON\", the four indicators (Power, Low Oxygen, Normal Oxygen, and Call Service) on the front panel will light up momentarily. After a few seconds, only the Power and Oxygen indicators will remain on. The indicator lights on the front panel are defined as follows: • Green: The level of oxygen produced is normal. (LED will display \"Normal • Yellow: The level of oxygen produced is low. (LED will show \"Low Oxygen\") If the oxygen purity drops below an acceptable level, the green normal oxygen light will turn off and the yellow low oxygen light will turn on. Switch to your oxygen backup system. If there is a problem, contact your medical provider. As an added safety feature if the oxygen purity continues to decrease, an alarm sound will sound. Call your medical provider right away. Do not try other treatments. NOTES: If low frequency and vibration sound are heard, the unit is not operating properly. Contact your Oxygen Concentrator provider if necessary. Check the flow meter to ensure that the ball indicator in the flow meter is centered on the line next to the specified amount of your flow rate. ATTENTION: It is very important to follow your oxygen prescription. Do not increase or decrease oxygen flow - consult your doctor. NOTES: Your medical provider may have adjusted the flow meter so that it cannot be adjusted. NOTES: If the flow meter knob is turned clockwise, the flow decreases (and will eventually shut off the oxygen flow). If the knob is turned counterclockwise, the flow increases. OXYGEN RESERVE SYSTEM As a precaution, your medical provider can provide an oxygen backup system. If your unit loses power or fails to operate properly, a “Patient Alert System” will sound to switch to your oxygen backup system (if provided) and contact your medical provider.
