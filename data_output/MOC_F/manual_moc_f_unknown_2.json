Electromagnetism is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/wireless) and land mobile radio, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcasts, and TV broadcasts cannot be predicted with theoretical accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength at the location where the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR must be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be required, such as reorientation or relocation of the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR. b. In the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, the field strength must be less than 3 V/m. ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 1. Waste and residue treatment Do not throw away the Nasal Cannula, moisturizing bottle and other components, can take it to the nearest professional medical center. 2. When the machine is disposed of, please contact your local supplier or manufacturer. 3. Disposal of waste and residue must be in accordance with relevant state laws and regulations. PT.
