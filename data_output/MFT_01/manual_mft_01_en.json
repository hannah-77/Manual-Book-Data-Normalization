Note The Infrared Thermometer is suitable for use with the following symbol: NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies. NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the Infrared Thermometer is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the Infrared Thermometer should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the Infrared Thermometer. b. Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m. Table 4: Recommended separation distances Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the Infrared Thermometer The Infrared Thermometer is intended for use in the electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled. The purchaser or the user of the Infrared Thermometer can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment (transmitters) and the Infrared Thermometer as recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communications equipment. Separation distance according to power of transmitter (m) Rated power of tra ( n W sm ) itter 150k d H = z 1 – . 8 1 0 7 MHz 80 M M H H z z – 800 80 2 0 .7 M G H H z z – P d=0.17 P d=2 P .33 0.01 0.12 0.12 0.23 0.1 0.38 0.38 0.73 1 1.2 1.2 2.3 10 3.8 3.8 7.3 100 12 12 23 For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the recommended separation distanced in meters (m) can be estimated using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where P is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) according to the transmitter manufacturer. NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the separation distance for the higher frequency range applies. NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people.  Don’t near active HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT and the RF shielded room of an ME SYSTEM for magnetic resonance imaging, where the intensity of EM DISTURBANCES is high.  Use of this equipment adjacent to or stacked with other equipment should be avoided because it could result in improper operation. If such use is necessary, this equipment and the other equipment should be observed to verify that they are operating normally.  Use of accessories, transducers and cables other than those specified or provided by the manufacturer of this equipment could result in increased electromagnetic emissions or decreased electromagnetic immunity of this equipment and result in improper operation.”  Portable RF communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 30 cm (12 inches) to any part of the TP500, including cables specified by the manufacturer.Otherwise, degradation of the performance of this equipment could result.  The EMISSIONS characteristics of this equipment make it suitable for use in industrial areas and hospitals (CISPR 11 class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 class B is normally required) this equipment might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to take mitigation measures, such as relocating or re-orienting the equipment. PT. SINKO PRIMA ALLOY Alamat : Jl.
