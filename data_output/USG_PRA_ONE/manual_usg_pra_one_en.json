    "4.1 Inspeksi Umum": "9.2.1 Probe Inspection Before and after use, carefully inspect the probe lens, cable, case, and connector: Look for any damage that might allow liquid to enter the probe. If damage is found, do not use the probe until the probe has been inspected and repaired/replaced by an authorized technician. Keeps a log of all probe maintenance, along with pictures of any probe malfunctions. The probe is designed for use only with this ultrasound system. Using this probe on other systems or an unqualified probe may result in electric shock or damage to the system/transducer: 9.2.2 Cleaning and Disinfecting  Place the probe into the cleaning-disinfectant solution. Be sure not to immerse the probe in liquid beyond the level of immersion given in the figure below. Ensure that the probe is immersed with the cleaner-disinfectant to the level of immersion during the entire disinfection time.  For recommended cleaning and disinfection times, please refer to your operating instructions.  Rinse the probe with sufficient clean drinking water, to remove all disinfectant residue. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR  Use a soft cloth to clean cables and probe parts used with a disinfectant-cleaning solution. Make sure that the surface of the probe and cable is thoroughly moistened with a disinfectant-cleaner.  Allow the probe to air dry completely.  Reconnect the probe to the ultrasound console and place the probe in the holder. Probe Immersion Level This transducer is not designed to withstand heat sterilization methods. Exposure to temperatures over 60°C will cause permanent damage. Transducers are not designed to be completely immersed in a liquid, permanent damage will occur if the entire transducer is submerged. Probe Safety Handling precaution Ultrasound probes are very sensitive medical instruments that are easily damaged by improper handling. Be careful when using and protect against damage when not in use. DO NOT use a damaged or defective probe. Failure to follow these precautions could result in injury and serious equipment damage. Electrical Shock Hazard The probe is driven by electrical energy which can injure the patient or user if live internal parts are connected by a conductive fluid:  DO NOT immerse the probe in a liquid beyond the level indicated by the level of immersion of the probe. Do not immerse the probe connector in any liquid.  Before use, check the probe lens and areas for cracks, cuts, tears, and other signs of physical damage. DO NOT use a probe that appears damaged until you have verified its functional and safe performance. You will need to do a more thorough check, including cables, and connectors, each time you clean the probe.  Before inserting the connector into the probe port, check the probe connector pins. If the pin is bent, DO NOT use the probe until the probe has been inspected and repaired/replaced by an authorized PT. Sinko Prima Alloy.  Electrical leakage checks must be carried out regularly by authorized technicians of PT. Sinko Prima Alloy or qualified hospital staff. Mechanical Hazard: A faulty or overloaded probe can cause patient injury or probe damage:  Observe depth markings and do not apply excessive force when inserting or manipulating the endocavitary probe.  Check for sharp edges or rough surfaces on the probe that could injure sensitive tissue.  DO NOT apply excessive force to the probe connector when inserting it into the probe port. The probe connector pins can be bent. Special handling instructions Using protective sheaths The use of clear protective sheaths on the market is recommended for clinical applications. FDA reference March 29, 1991 \"Medical Alert on Latex Products\". PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR Protective gloves may be required to minimize disease transmission. The probe protective sheath is available for use with all clinical situations where infection is feared. It is strongly recommended to use a sterile probe protective sheath which is marketed legally for endocavitary procedures. DO NOT use a lubricated condom as a sheath. In some cases, this can damage the probe. The lubricant in this condom may not be compatible with the probe construction. Devices containing latex can cause severe allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals. Referring to the FDA March 29, 1991 \"Medical Alert on Latex Products\". DO NOT use expired probe safety sheaths. Before using a safety glove, verify if it has expired. Endocavitary Probe Handling Precaution If sterilizing fluid leaks from the endocavitary probe, follow the precautions below: Exposure to sterilization for the Patient (eg, Cidex): Contact with sterilization of the patient's skin on the mucous membranes can cause inflammation. If this occurs, refer to the instruction manual of the sterilizer. Exposure Sterilization from Probe to Patient (eg Cidex): DO NOT allow the sterilizer to come into contact with the patient. Only immerse the probe to the specified level. Ensure that no liquid enters the probe handle before scanning the patient. If the sterilizer comes in contact with the patient, refer to the sterilization instructions. Exposure Sterilization from Probe Connector to Patient (E.g. Cidex):DO NOT allow the sterilizer to come into contact with the patient. Only immerse the probe to a predetermined level. Ensure that no liquid enters the probe connector before scanning the patient. If the sterilizer is in contact with the patient, refer to the sterilization manual. Endocavitary Probe Point of Contact: Refer to the sterilization manual. Probe Handling and Infection Control This information is intended to increase user awareness of the risk of disease transmission associated with the use of this equipment and to provide guidance in making decisions that directly affect the safety of patients and users of the equipment. Diagnostic ultrasound systems utilize ultrasound energy which must be coupled to the patient through direct physical contact. Depending on the type of examination, this contact occurs with various tissues ranging from the skin in routine examinations to blood circulation in surgical procedures. The level of risk of infection varies greatly depending on the type of contact. One of the most effective ways to prevent transmission between patients is to use a single-use device or device. However, ultrasound transducers are complex and expensive devices that must be reused between patients. It is very important, therefore, to minimize the risk of disease transmission by using barriers and through proper processing between patients. Risk of Infection ALWAYS clean and sterilize the probe between patients to a level appropriate for the type of examination and use the appropriate FDA probe holster. Adequate cleaning and disinfection is necessary to prevent disease transmission. It is the responsibility of the equipment user to verify and maintain the effectiveness of the infection control procedures used. Always use sterile, legally marketed probe sheaths for intra-cavitary procedures. Probe Cleaning Process: DISCONNECT the probe from the system before cleaning/disinfecting the probe. Failure to do so may damage the system Probe Cleaning after Each Use  Remove the probe from the ultrasound console and remove all gel from the probe by wiping with a soft cloth and rinsing under running water.  Wash the probe with mild soap in lukewarm water. Rub the probe as needed using a soft sponge, gauze, or cloth to PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR remove any visible residue from the surface of the probe. Prolonged soaking or scrubbing with a soft bristle brush (such as a toothbrush) may be necessary if the material has dried onto the probe surface. To avoid electric shock, always turn off the system and remove the probe before cleaning the probe. Be careful when handling the lens surface of the ultrasound transducer: the lens surface is very sensitive and can be easily damaged by rough handling. DO NOT use excessive force when cleaning the lens surface. Rinse the probe with enough clean drinking water to remove any visible soap residue. Air dry or a soft cloth. To minimize the risk of infection from blood-borne pathogens, you should handle the probe and all materials that have been in contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and skin in accordance with infection control procedures. You should wear protective gloves when handling infectious materials. Use a face shield and medical gown if there is a risk of splashing. Probe Disinfection After each use, please sterilize the probe. Ultrasound probes can be disinfected using a chemical disinfectant. The degree of disinfection is directly related to the duration of contact with the disinfectant. Increased contact time results in higher rates of disinfection. For the disinfectant to be effective, all visible residue must be removed during the cleaning process. Clean the probe well, as described before attempting disinfection. You must remove the probe from the system before cleaning/disinfecting the probe. Failure to do so may damage the DO NOT immerse the probe in the disinfectant for longer than the instructions for the disinfectant used. Prolonged immersion may result in probe damage resulting in a possible electric shock hazard.  Prepare the disinfectant according to the manufacturer's instructions. Be sure to follow all precautions for storage, use and disposal. Transducers are not designed to be completely immersed in a liquid. Permanent damage will occur if the entire transducer is submerged. The submerged portion must not extend beyond the transducer edge.  Place the probe clean and dry in contact with the disinfectant for the time specified by the disinfectant manufacturer. High-level disinfection is recommended for probe surfaces and is required for endocavitary probes (follow the germicidal manufacturer's recommended time).  Once removed from the disinfectant, rinse the probe following the rinse instructions from the manufacturer of this disinfectant. Flush all visible residue from the probe and allow to air dry. Ultrasound transducers can be easily damaged by improper handling and contact with certain chemicals. Failure to follow these precautions could result in serious injury and equipment damage.  Do not immerse the probe in liquid beyond the level specified for the probe. Never immerse the transducer connector or probe adapter in any liquid  Avoid mechanical impact on the transducer and do not use excessive force to fold or pull the cable.  Transducer damage can result from contact with an inappropriate cleaning fluid.  Do not immerse or immerse the transducer in liquids containing alcohol, bleach, ammounium chloride, or hydrogen PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR  Avoid contact with liquids or gels that contain mineral oil or lanolin.  Avoid temperatures above 60oC. Under no circumstances can the transducer use the heat sterilization method. Exposure to temperatures above 60°C will cause permanent damage to the transducer.  Check the probe before use for any damage or degeneration of the housing, lens, seals, etc. Do not use damaged or deformed probes. Coupling Gel DO NOT use a non-recommended gel (lubricant). The gel may damage the probe and void the warranty. Gel recommendation: Aquasonic Gel by R. P Kincheloe Company (United States). To ensure optimal transmission of energy between the patient and the probe, the conductive gel must be evenly applied to the patient where the scan is to be performed. Do not use gels or other materials not provided by PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. Gels, lubricants and other materials can corrode the probe and other parts of the device, such as the keyboard. This can reduce the safety and effectiveness of the system and probe, and can also reduce the life time of the system and probe. Damage caused by reasons as above is not covered by the warranty. DO NOT apply the gel to the eyes. If gel comes into contact with eyes, flush eyes with clean water. The coupling gel must not contain any of the following ingredients as these are known to cause probe damage:  Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or other alcohol-based products.  mineral oil  aloe vera  Olive oil  Methyl or Ethyl Paraben (Parahydrobenzoic Acid)  Dimethyl Silicone Planned Maintenance The following maintenance plans are recommended for the system and probes to ensure optimal operation and safety. Daily: check the probes. After each use: clean the probe, sterilize the probe. Necessary: inspect the probe, clean the probe, and disinfect the probe. Returning/Shipping of Probes and Repair Parts Our transportation department and policies require that equipment returned for service MUST be clean and free of blood and other infectious substances. When you return a probe or part for service, you will need to clean and sterilize the probe or part prior to packing and shipping the equipment. Make sure that you follow the probe cleaning and disinfection instructions given in this manual. This ensures that employees in the transportation industry as well as people who receive packages are protected from any PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR AIUM's Endocavitary Transducer Cleaning Outline Guidelines for Cleaning and Preparation of Endocavitary Ultrasound Transducers among Patients from AIUM Approved June 4, 2003 The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines regarding the cleaning and disinfection of transvaginal and transrectal ultrasound probes. All sterilization/disinfection represented a statistical reduction in the number of microbes on the surface. Careful cleaning of the instrument is an important icon for the initial reduction of the microbial/organic load by at least 99%. This cleaning is followed by a disinfection procedure to ensure a high level of protection from the transmission of infectious diseases, even if disposable barriers cover the instrument during use. Medical instruments fall into different categories according to their potential for transmission of infection. The most important level of the instrument is that which is meant to penetrate the skin or mucous membranes. This instrument requires sterilization. Less critical instruments (often called \"semi-critical\" instruments) that only come into contact with mucous membranes such as fiber-optic endoscopes require high-level disinfection rather than sterilization. Although endocavitary ultrasound probes are considered less critical instruments because they are routinely protected using disposable probe protectors, recent studies suggest a leakage rate of 0.9% - 2% for condoms and 8% -81% for commercial probe guards. For maximum safety, a high level of disinfection should be carried out on the probe between each use and using a probe cover or condom as an aid in keeping the probe clean. There are four generally recognized categories for disinfection and sterilization. Sterilization is the complete elimination of all forms or microbial life including spores and viruses. Disinfection is the selective removal of microbial life, divided into three classes: High Level Disinfection - Destruction/removal of all microorganisms except bacterial spores. Intermediate Disinfection - Inactivation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, bacteria, most viruses, fungi, and some bacterial Low Level Disinfection- Destruction of most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi. Low-level disinfection will not always inactivate Mycobacterium tuberculosis or bacterial spores. The following specific recommendations are made for the use of the Endocavitary Ultrasound transducer. Users should also review Central Disease Control and Prevention's documents on sterilization and disinfection of medical devices to ensure that procedures comply with CDC principles for disinfecting patient equipment.

    "4.4 Pembersihan": "1. CLEANING After removing the probe cover, use running water to remove any remaining gel or dirt from the probe. Use a soft gauze or other soft cloth and a small amount of mild non-abrasive liquid soap (household dish soap) to thoroughly clean the transducer. Use a small brush especially for crevices and areas of angulation depending on the particular transducer design. Rinse the transducer thoroughly under running water, then dry the transducer with a soft cloth or paper towel. 2. DISINFECTION Cleaning with a detergent/liquid solution as described above is important as the first step in proper disinfection because chemical disinfectants act more quickly on clean surfaces. However, the additional use of a high-level disinfectant liquid would ensure a further statistical reduction in the microbial load. Because of the potential for disruption of the barrier sheath, additional high-level disinfection with chemicals is required. Examples of such high level disinfectants include but are not limited to:  2% glutaraldehyde product (various products available include \"Cidex\" \"Metricide\" or \"Procide\").  Non-glutaraldehyde agents include Cidex OPA (o-phthalaldehyde), Cidex PA (hydrogen peroxide & peroxyacetic PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR  7.5% Hydrogen Peroxide Solution.  Bleach used in households (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) is diluted to produce 500 parts per million chlorine (10 cc in one liter of tap water). These agents are effective, but are generally not recommended by probe manufacturers because they can damage metals and plastics. Other agents such as ammonium compounds are not considered high-level disinfectants and should not be used. Isopropanol is not a high-level disinfectant when used as a wipe and probe manufacturers generally do not recommend immersing the probe in liquid. The FDA has published a list of approved sterilants and high-level disinfectants for use in the processing of reusable medical and dental equipment. This list can be referenced to find agents that may be useful for probe disinfection. Practitioners should refer to product labels for specific instructions. The practitioner should also consult the device manufacturer regarding the compatibility of the agent with the probe. Many chemical disinfectants are potentially toxic and many require adequate precautions such as proper ventilation, personal protective equipment (gloves, eye/face protection, etc.) and thorough rinsing before the probe is reused. 3. PROBE COVERS The transducer must be covered with a barrier. If the barrier used is a condom, the condom must be unlubricated and unmedicated. Practitioners should be aware that condoms have been shown to be less susceptible to leakage than commercial probe protectors, and have a sixfold increased AQL (acceptable quality level) when compared to standard examination gloves. It has the same AQL as a surgical glove. Users should be aware of latex-sensitivity issues and provide a non-latex barrier. 4. ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE For the protection of patients and healthcare workers, all endocavitary examinations should be performed with a gloved operator during the procedure. Gloves should be used to remove condoms or other obstructions from the transducer and wash the transducer as described above. While the barrier/condom is removed, care must be taken not to contaminate the probe with secretions from the patient. At the end of the procedure, hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and NOTES: Obvious impairment in condom integrity does NOT require modification of this protocol. These guidelines take into account the possibility of probe contamination due to interference in the barrier sheath. Briefly, high-level disinfection of the endocavitary probe between patients, plus the use of a probe cover or condom during the examination is necessary to protect the patient from infection during the endocavitary examination. For all chemical disinfectants, precautions must be taken to protect workers and patients from the toxicity of the disinfectant. Amis S, Ruddy M, Kibbler CC, Economides DL, MacLean AB.

After the exam is complete, follow the appropriate cleaning and disinfection, or sterilization procedures. 9.3.2 Transvaginal Probe Operation The transvaginal probe is an endo-cavity probe, for operation safety, please refer to \"Care and Maintenance\" for cleaning and disinfection. The temperature at the probe tip is displayed on the screen for monitoring. Temperatures above 43 ° C are not allowed. It also depends on the patient's body temperature. When the probe tip temperature exceeds 43°C, the probe will stop working to protect the patient. The transvaginal probe should be used with an FDA-approved condom or probe cap. Refer to the following instructions for placing the probe into the condom:  Some patients may be allergic to natural rubber or medical devices containing rubber. The FDA recommends identifying these patients and preparing to treat allergic reactions immediately prior to the scan.  Only water-soluble liquids or gels can be used. Petroleum-based or mineral oil-based materials can harm the cover.  When the transvaginal probe is activated outside the patient's body, the acoustic output level must be reduced to avoid harmful interference to other equipment. Operating Procedure:  Wear medical sterile gloves  Take the condom for the package.  Open the condom.  Put some ultrasound gel into the condom.  Take the condom with one hand, and place the probe head against the condom.  Tighten the condom at the end of the probe grip.  Confirm the integrity of the condom, and repeat the above steps for the condom if any damage is found. 9.3.3 Cleaning and Disinfecting TV and TR Probes We strongly recommend wearing gloves when cleaning and disinfecting each endocavitary probe.  Each time before and after each examination, please clean the probe handle and sterilize the transvaginal and transrectal probes using a chemical disinfectant.  If the probe is contaminated with body fluids, you must disinfect the probe after cleaning.  Assume exam waste is potentially infectious and dispose of it in accordance with procedures. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR  Since the probe is not waterproof, you must remove the probe from the system before cleaning or disinfecting it. Before and after each examination, please clean the probe handle and disinfect the transvaginal and transcretal probe using a chemical disinfectant. You can clean the transvaginal and transrectal probes to remove all the gel by wiping with a soft cloth and rinsing under running water. Then wash the probe with mild soap in lukewarm water. Rub the probe as necessary and use a soft cloth to remove any visible residue from the surface of the transvaginal probe. Rinse the probe with sufficient clean drinking water to remove all visible soap residue, and allow the probe to air dry. Please remove the cover (if any) before cleaning the probe. (Covers such as condoms can only be used once). When cleaning TV and TR probes, it is important to ensure that all surfaces are cleaned. Disinfection Glutaraldehyde based liquids have been shown to be very effective for this purpose. Cidex is the only disinfectant that has been evaluated for compatibility with the material used to make the probe. To maintain the effectiveness of the disinfection solution, a thorough cleaning should be carried out on the probe before disinfecting, making sure that no residue remains on the probe. Disinfecting Procedure:  Follow all precautions for storage, use and disposal, prepare the disinfectant according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Place the probe to be cleaned and dried for contact with the disinfectant, being careful not to allow the probe to fall to the bottom of the container which could damage the probe.  After placing/soaking the probe, rotate and wiggle the probe while it is under the surface of the disinfectant to remove any air pockets. Allow the germicide to remain soaked in the probe. For high-level disinfection, follow the manufacturer's recommended time.  Follow all precautions for storage, use and disposal, prepare the disinfectant according to the manufacturer's instructions.  After removing the probe from the disinfectant, rinse the probe according to the rinse instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Flush any visible residue of the disinfectant from the probe and allow it to air dry. 9.4 Service Responsibilities If the user installs, uses, and maintains the system in full accordance with the installation instructions from PT.

CAUTION: Be sure to use ONLY special USB disks or removable media for storing or backing up data. Before connecting to the ultrasound system, be sure to use the latest antivirus software such as a USB disk or removable media to clean any viruses. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the USB disk or removable media is free of viruses. Improper use of USB disks or removable media may result in virus infection of the system which may cause malfunctions. Such damage may impact the stability, effectiveness and safety of the system and probe, and use should be discontinued immediately until an authorized technician has inspected the system and confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the system and probe. CAUTION: Use only secure Local Area Network connections. Do not connect the ultrasound system to the internet. Make sure your hospital's firewall software is properly configured, thus blocking incoming connection requests from the internet. Improper use of network connection can lead to virus infection of the system and eventually malfunction may 2.5 Biological Safety This product, as with all diagnostic ultrasound equipment, must be used only for valid reasons and must be used for the shortest period of time and the lowest power setting required (ALARA – As Low as Reasonably Achievable) to produce an acceptable diagnostic image. AIUM provides the following guidelines: Clinical Safety quoted from AIUM Approved March 26, 1997 Diagnostic ultrasound has been used since the late 1950s. In light of its known benefits and recognized efficacy for medical diagnosis, including use during pregnancy, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine discusses the clinical safety of such use: No confirmed biologic effects on patient or instrument operator caused by exposure to current diagnostic ultrasound instruments Although it is possible that such biologic effects may be identified in the future, current data suggest that the benefits to patients from using diagnostic ultrasound outweigh the risks. Heating: Elevating tissue temperature during obstetric examinations can cause medical problems. At this stage of embryonic development, increased temperature and length of time of exposure can have potential adverse effects, especially during Color Doppler/Color Doppler examinations. Thermal Index (TI) provides a statistical estimate of the potential temperature elevation (in Celsius) of the tissue. Thermal Index consists of: Soft Tissue Thermal Index (TIS), Bone Thermal Index (TIB) and Cranial Bone Thermal Index (TIC). Soft Tissue Thermal Index (TIS). Used for soft tissue imaging only, TIS provides an estimate of the potential for temperature elevation in soft tissue. Bone Thermal Index (TIB). Used when the bone is near the image focus as in the third trimester OB examination, the TIB provides an estimate of the potential for temperature elevation in the adjacent bone or soft tissue. Cranial Bone Thermal Index (TIC). Used when bone is in close proximity to the skin surface as in a transcranial PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR examination, the TIC provides an estimate of the potential temperature increase in the adjacent bone or soft tissue. Cavitation: Cavitation can occur when ultrasound waves pass through a hollow area, such as a gas bubble or air pocket (in the lungs or intestines, for example). During the cavitation process, sound waves can cause the bubbles to contract or resonate. These oscillations can cause the bubble to burst and damage the tissue. The Mechanical Index (Ml) has been created to help users accurately evaluate the possibility of cavitation and associated side effects. MI recognizes the importance of non-thermal processes, in particular cavitation, and the Index is an attempt to demonstrate the likelihood of their occurrence within the tissue. 2.6 Scanning Patient and Education The Track-3 or IEC60601-2-37 display output standard allows the user to take responsibility for the safe use of the ultrasound system. Follow the user manual for safe operation:  To keep the probe clean, always clean it before application to a new patient.  Always use a disinfected sheath on all EV/ER probes during each examination.  Move the probe continuously, do not stop in one place, to avoid increasing the temperature in one part of the patient's  Remove the probe from the patient when not performing the scan.  Understand the meaning of TI, TIS, TIB, TIC and MI display outputs, and the relationship between these parameters and tissue thermal/cavitation bioeffects.  Use the ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) principle during scanning. Safe Scanning Guidelines  Ultrasound should only be used for medical diagnosis and only by trained medical personnel.  Ultrasound diagnostic procedures should be performed only by personnel trained in the use of the device, interpretation of results and images, and safe use of ultrasound (including knowledge of potential hazards).  The operator must understand the possible effect of engine control, operating mode (eg mode B) and probe frequency on heating and cavitation hazards.  Select a low setting for each new patient. Output should only be increased during examination if penetration is still required to achieve satisfactory results, and after Gain control is moved to maximum value.  Keep examination times as short as necessary to produce useful diagnostic results.  Do not hold the probe in the same position for a longer time than necessary. Static and Cine frame capabilities allow images to be reviewed and discussed without requiring the patient to be scanned continuously  Do not use the endo-cavitary probe if there is an indication of heating on the probe when operating in air. While applicable to any probe, provide special care during transvaginal testing during the first eight weeks of pregnancy.  Give special care to reduce output and minimize exposure time of the embryo or fetus when the maternal temperature is already high.  Provide special care to reduce risk of thermal hazards during ultrasound diagnosis when exposure: embryo less than eight weeks after gestation; or the head, brain or spine of the fetus or neonate.  The operator must monitor the thermal index (Tl) and mechanical index (MI) values continuously and use control settings that keep the settings as low as possible but still achieve the appropriate diagnostic results. During the obstetrical examination, TIS (soft tissue thermal index) should be monitored during the scan performed in the first eight weeks after pregnancy, and TIB (bone thermal index) thereafter. In operations where the probe is very close to bone (eg trans-cranial), the TIC (cranial bone thermal index) should be monitored. Ml > 0.3 there is a chance of minor damage to the neonatal lung or gut. If exposure is required, reduce exposure time PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR as much as possible. Ml > 0.7 there is a risk of cavitation if an ultrasound contrast agent containing gaseous micro-spheres is being used. There is a theoretical risk of cavitation in the absence of an ultrasound contrast agent. The risk will increase if the MI values are above the threshold. Tl > 0.7 the overall exposure time of the embryo or fetus should be limited according to Table 2-2 below for reference: Tl Maximum exposure time Maximum recommended exposure time for embryo or fetus  The non-diagnostic use of ultrasound equipment is generally not recommended. Examples of non-diagnostic uses of ultrasound equipment include repeated scans for operator training, demonstration of the equipment using normal subjects, and the production of images or videos of the fetus. For equipment where the displayed safety index exceeds the range of values, TI should always be less than 0.5 and MI should always be less than 0.3. Avoid repeated and too frequent exposure to the subject. Scans in the first trimester of pregnancy should not be performed solely for the production of souvenir videos or photographs, or productions that involve increasing exposure levels or prolonging scan times beyond those required for clinical purposes.  Diagnostic ultrasound has the potential to produce a false positive or false negative output. Misdiagnosis is far more dangerous than the possible effects of ultrasound exposure. Therefore, ultrasound diagnostic systems should only be operated by those with adequate training and education. Understanding MI/IT Display Track-3 follows the Output Display Standard for systems that include Fetal Doppler applications. Acoustic output will not be evaluated on an application-specific basis, but the global maximum at de-rated Ispta must be 720 mW/cm2 and global maximum MI must be 1.9 or global maximum at de-rated Isppa must be 190 W/cm2. Exception for use on the eye, where TI = max (TIS_as, TIC) does not exceed1.0; Ispta.3 50mW/cm2, and MI 0.23. The Track-3 gives the user the freedom to increase the acoustic power output in a given test, while still limiting the acoustic power output within the Ispta de-rated maximum global range of 720 mW/cm2 after the Output Display Standard. For each diagnostic ultrasonic system, Track-3 provides Standard Output Indices Display. The diagnostic ultrasonic system and operating manual contain information on ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) education for clinical users and the output of acoustic, MI and TI indices. MI describes the possibility of cavitation, and TI offers a prediction of the maximum temperature rise in the tissue as a result of the diagnostic workup. In general, a temperature increase of 2.5 °C must be present consistently at one point for 2 hours to cause an abnormal fetus. Avoiding a local temperature rise above 1 °C will ensure that no biological effects due to thermal induction occur. When referring to TI for potential thermal effects, TI equal to 1 does not mean the temperature will rise 1 degree Celsius. It just means a potential increase for thermal effects can occur as TI increases. A high index does not mean that a bio-effect is occurring, but simply indicates that there is potential and no consideration was given to the TI during the scan, so minimizing the overall scan time will reduce the potential effect. Operator controls and feature displays shift the responsibility for security from the manufacturer to the user. It is very important for the ultrasound system to display the acoustic index output correctly and educate the user to interpret the values obtained correctly. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR RF: (De-rating factor) Insitu intensity and pressure can not be measured at this time. Therefore, acoustic power measurements are usually carried out in water tanks, and when soft tissue displaces water along the ultrasound route, there will be a decrease in intensity. The fractional reduction in intensity caused by attenuation is denoted by the de-rating factor (RF), RF = 10 (-0.1 afz) Where a is the attenuation coefficient in dB cm-1 MHz-1, f is the center frequency of the transducer, and z is the distance along the beam axis between the source and the point of interest. The RF de-rating factors for various distances and frequencies with an attenuation coefficient of 0.3dB cm-1 MHz-1 in homogeneous soft tissue are listed in the following table. For example, if the user is using the 7.5MHz frequency, the power will be attenuated by 0.0750 at 5cm, or 0.3x7.5x5 = -1 l.25dB. The de-rated intensity is also referred to as '0.3' at the end (eg lspta.3). Frequency (MHz) (cm) 1 3 5 7.5 1 0.9332 0.8128 0.7080 0.5957 2 0.8710 0.6607 0.5012 0.3548 3 0.8128 0.5370 0.3548 0.2113 4 0.7586 0.4365 0.2512 0.1259 5 0.7080 0.3548 0.1778 0.0750 6 0.6607 0.2884 0.1259 0.0447 7 0.6166 0.2344 0.0891 0.0266 8 0.5754 0.1903 0.0631 0.0158 I'= I * RF where I' is the intensity in soft tissue, I is the time-averaged intensity measured in water. Tissue Models: The tissue temperature elevation depends on the power, tissue type, beam width, and scan mode. Six models were developed to mimic possible clinical situations. Thermal Model Composition Mode Specification Application Large aperture (>l cm2) TIS Soft Tissue Not scanned PW Liver Small aperture (<l cm2) TIS Soft Tissue Not scanned Pencil Probes 3 Evaluated on TIS Soft Tissue Scanned Breast color 4 Soft tissue in TIB Soft tissue and bone Scanned Muscle color 5 TIB Soft tissue and bone Not scanned Bones on focus PW Fetal Head 6 TIC Soft tissue and bone Not scanned / Bone on the surface Transcranial PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR Soft tissue: Describes low-fat tissue that does not contain calcification or is filled with a lot of gas. Scanned: (auto-scan) Refers to the system of directing successive exposures through the field of view, e.g. mode B and color. Unscanned: The emission of the ultrasonic pulse occurs along one line of sight and does not change until the transducer moves to a new position. For example, PW and M modes. TI is defined as the ratio of the In Situ acoustic power (W.3) to the acoustic power required to raise the tissue temperature by 1°C (Wdeg), TI = W.3 / Wdeg.Three TIs refer to soft tissue (TIS) for the abdomen; bone (TIB) for fetal and neonatal heads; and cranial bones (TIC) for the head of children and adults, have been developed to Wdeg= 21O/fc, for models 1 to 4, where fc is the center frequency in MHz. Wdeg = 40 KD for models 5 and 6, where K (ray form factor) is 1.0, D is aperture diameter in cm at depth of interest. Cavitation is more likely to occur at high pressures and low frequencies in pulsed ultrasound waves in tissues, which contain bubbles or air sacs (eg, lungs, intestines, or scans with contrast agent gases). The threshold for optimum conditions for the ultrasound pulse is predicted by the ratio of the pressure peak to the square root of the frequency. MI = Pr' / sqrt (fc) Pr' is the fraction of the de-rated peak (0.3) pressure in Mpa at the point where PII is maximum, and fc is the center frequency in MHz. PII is the Pulse Intensity Integral where the total energy per unit area carried by the wave is for the duration of the pulse time. Peak fractional pressure is measured in negative maximum hydrophone voltage normalized with hydrophone calibration parameters. Display Guidelines: For different operating modes, different indexes must be displayed. But only one index needs to be displayed at a time. Display is not required if the maximum MI is less than 1.0 for each setting of the operating mode, or if the maximum TI is less than 1.0 for each setting of the operating mode. For TI, if TIS and TIB are greater than 1.0, the scanner does not need to display both indexes at the same time. If the index falls below 0.4, the display is not needed. Display increments of less than 0.2 for index values less than 1.0 and no greater than 1.0 for index values greater than one (e.g. 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, and 3). Display and Reports Located at the top center of the monitor screen, the acoustic output display provides the operator with a real-time indication of the acoustic level produced by the system. Displays only MI, from 0.4 if maximum MI > 1.0, display increases by a multiple of 0.2. Below is a simple guide for users when TI exceeds the one exposure time limit to 4(6-TI) minutes according to the 'National Council on Radiation Protection. Exposure Criteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound: I. Criteria Based on Thermal Mechanisms. Report No. 113 1992'. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR Operator Control Features: The user should understand that certain operator settings may affect the acoustic output. It is recommended to use the default output power setting (or lowest output) and compensate using the Gain setting to obtain the image. In addition to setting the output power in the soft-menu, which has a direct impact on power; PRF, image sector size, frame rate, depth, and focal position also slightly affect the output power. The default setting is usually around 70% of the allowable power depending on the measurement mode application. Control Affecting Acoustic Output The potential to produce mechanical (Ml) or thermal (Tl) bioeffects can be affected by certain settings. Direct: The Acoustic Output setting has the most significant effect on the acoustic output. Indirect: Indirect effects may occur when adjusting settings. The controls that can affect MI and TI are detailed under the bioeffect of each setting in the Image Optimization chapter. Always observe the Acoustic Output display for possible Best practices when scanning HINT: Increase Acoustic Output only after attempting image optimization with settings that have no effect on acoustic output, such as Gain and STC. WARNING: Be sure to read and understand the setting descriptions for each mode used before attempting to adjust the Acoustic Output settings or settings that may affect the acoustic output. Use the minimum required acoustic output to obtain the best diagnostic image or measurement during the examination. Begin the examination with a probe that provides optimal depth of focus and penetration. Acoustic Output Default Level To ensure that the scan does not start at a high output level, the system starts the scan at a reduced default output level. This level is programmed by default and depends on the probe and probe icon selected. The effect takes effect when the system is powered on or New Patient is selected. To modify the acoustic output, adjust the Power Output level on the Soft 2.7 Battery Handling Instructions CAUTION: Read and observe the following warnings and precautions to ensure the correct and safe use of Li-ion batteries.  Do not immerse the battery in water or allow the battery to get wet.  Do not use or store the battery near a heat source such as a fire or heater.  Do not use chargers other than those recommended.  Do not reverse the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals.  Do not connect the battery directly to a car receptacle or cigarette lighter socket.

One of the images is in real-time status; the other is in a frozen state. Real-time images have scan markers and ruler markers. Press button 2B in B/B mode, the active initial image is in freeze state while the freeze initial image is activated. In freeze state, press [2B] to select the B mode image to be activated when turning off image freeze. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR 5.5.3 4B Mode Press [4B] button to enter 4B mode, the screen will display 4B mode images side by side, but only one image in real-time status. Press the button again to switch real-time status among the four images. In freeze state, press [4B] to select the B mode image to be activated when deactivating image freeze. 5.5.4 B/M Mode Press the [B/M] button, the B mode real time image and M mode real time image will be displayed at the same time. A sample line will appear in the B mode image area, indicating the current sample position for the M image in the B image area. Move the sampling line with the trackball. 5.5.5 M Mode Press the [M] button again, the B mode image will disappear; M mode image is still active on the whole screen. The M mode image represents the tissue movement status in the sampling line. The M mode image varies with time, so it is often used for cardiac applications. 5.5.6 CFM Mode CFM is a Doppler mode that is intended to add color-coded qualitative information about the relative velocity and direction of fluid motion in B mode images. CFM is useful for viewing flow over a wide area. This allows the visualization of flow at CROI, while the Doppler mode provides spectral information over a smaller area. CFM is also used as a stepping stone to Doppler mode. You can use CFM to search for flows and vessels before activating Doppler mode. In CFM mode, the trackball moves to change the position of the sampling box. Activate [Steering Angle] and turn the [MENU] knob to adjust the angle of the colored sampling box (if the current probe is linear probe). Press the [ENTER] key to correct the sampling position of the colored sample box. At that time, adjust the size of the colored sample box through the motion of the trackball. Press the [ENTER] key again and move the trackball to change the color sampling position again. Press [C] to enter CFM mode; after the [C] button light is on, turn the [GAIN] dial to adjust the gain of the CFM mode Exam Procedure:  Follow the same procedure as described in mode B to locate the desired anatomical area.  After optimizing the B mode image, add Color Flow.  Move the color region of interest CROI as close to the center of the image as possible.  Optimize color flow parameters so that high frame rates can be achieved and precise flow rates can be visualized.  Press the [FREEZE] button to hold the image in cine memory.  Record the required color flow images. CFM Scanning Hints: PRF: increase/decrease PRF on color bar. Higher velocity flow imaging requires increasing the velocity scale value to avoid aliasing Wall Filters: affect low flow sensitivity to motion artifacts Colormaps: allows you to select a specific color map. It shows the direction of flow and highlights the higher speed Color Gain: increase the overall power of the echo process in CROI Persistence: affects temporal smoothing and color Doppler strength PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR 5.5.7 PW Mode Doppler is intended to provide measurement data regarding the speed at which tissues and fluids move. PW Doppler allows you to examine selective blood flow data from a small area called a Volume Sample. The X axis represents time while the Y axis represents velocity either forward or reverse. PW Doppler is commonly used to display the velocity, direction, and spectral content of blood flow at selected anatomic sites. PW Doppler can be combined with mode B for fast selection of anatomic areas for PW Doppler examination. The area where the PW Doppler data originates will display a B mode image graphically (Sampling Volume Gate). The Volume Gate sample can be moved anywhere in the B mode drawing. PW mode Exam procedure:  Get a good B mode image. Press the [C] key to help locate the vessel you want to examine.  Press the [D] key to display the volume and gate sample cursors.  Position the sample volume cursor by moving the trackball left and right. Position or re-measure the gate sample volume by moving the trackball up and down, then press [ENTER].  Press [Update] to display the PW Doppler spectrum and the system will run in combined Doppler+B mode. The Doppler signal can be heard through the speakers.  Optimize the PW Doppler spectrum as needed.  Make sure that the sample line is parallel to the blood flow.  Press [FREEZE] to hold the trace in the cine memory and stop imaging.  Do measurements and calculations, if necessary.  Record results with your recording device.  Press [FREEZE] to continue imaging.  Repeat the above procedure until all relevant flow areas have been examined.  Place the probes in their respective holders. When entering Duplex mode for the first time, the Doppler spectrum is not yet activated. The Volume Sample Doppler appears at the default position, and the B or 2D image mode (either B or Color) is active. Moving the trackball changes the position of the Volume Sample. Press the [ENTER] key to toggle the trackball function between Volume Gate Sample and measure. Press the [Update] button after the Volume Gate Sample is used to activate Spectral Doppler mode. Press the [Update] button a second time to switch back to 2D (B or Color) and disable Spectral Doppler. Doppler mode scanning tips: The best Doppler data will be obtained when the scanning direction is parallel to the direction of blood flow; when the scan direction is perpendicular to the anatomical target, you can get the best B mode images, so you have to maintain a balance because you don't usually get both ideal B mode images and ideal Doppler data at the same time. PRF: adjusts the speed scale to accommodate faster/slower speeds of blood flow. The speed scale determines the frequency of pulse repetition. Wall Filters: eliminates noise caused by vessel wall or heart movement by decreasing flow sensitivity. Baseline: adjusts baseline to accommodate faster or slower blood flow to eliminate aliasing. Angle: optimize flow velocity accuracy. Angle will estimate the flow velocity at an angle to the Doppler vector by calculating the angle between the Doppler vector and the flow to be measured. It is specially used in vascular applications where you need to measure velocity. Doppler Gain: allows you to control the background spectral information. Sweep Speed: speed control of spectral update. PRA-ONE DIGITAL USG MONITOR Volume Gate Sample Doppler Position and Size (Trackball and ENTER) Move the sample volume in B mode in the Doppler cursor. The gate is positioned above a certain area in the blood vessel.  To move the Doppler cursor position, move the trackball left or right until it is above the blood vessel.  To move the sample volume gate position, move the trackball up or down until it is positioned in the vessel.  To set the gate volume sample size, press [ENTER] to switch the trackball function from the gate sample volume position to size, then move the trackball to change the gate sample volume size. 5.6 B Image Adjustment 5.6.1 Frequency In real-time state, press the first row button [Frequency] to increase the frequency, and press the second row button [Frequency] to decrease the frequency. 5.6.2 Dynamic Dynamic range is used to adjust B mode image contrast resolution, compression or enlarge the greyscale display range.
