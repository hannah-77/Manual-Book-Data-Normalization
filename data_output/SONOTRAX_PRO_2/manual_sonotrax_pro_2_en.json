Chapter 4 FHR Examining Always check if the main unit and the probe are in good condition prior to use. Handle the probe with care. Do not drop it on hard surfaces. The 2MHz and 3MHz obstetrical probes are designed for FHR examining. The 2MHz probe is optimized for deep penetration and is widely used in the third trimester pregnancy. The 3MHz probe is a general purpose probe. It has better resolution and wider detection range than the 2MHz 5 Close the battery compartment cover. probe, therefore is optimized for early fetal heart detection. Follow these procedures to perform FHR examining: 1 Feel the position of the fetus by hand to find the best position to detect the fetal heart. 2 Switch on the Doppler and the probe. 3 Apply a small amount of coupling gel to the acoustic face of probe; place the probe face at the best position for detecting fetal heart. Angle the probe to obtain an optimum audio signal. Adjust the volume if required. 3.2.2 Fitting Wireless Probe Battery Clear fetal heart sound should be heard from the speakers/earphone, and numeric FHR value should be displayed on the LCD. The wireless probe is powered by a lithium battery. To fit the battery for the probe: 1 The best quality records will only be obtained if the probe is placed in the optimum 1 Remove the screw on the battery compartment cover with a screw driver and then take the position. cover away with your hand. 2 Positions with strong placental sounds or umbilical blood flow sound should be 3 If the fetus is in the cephalic position and the mother is supine, the clearest heart sound will normally be found on the midline below the umbilicus. During examining, the pregnant woman’s prolonged lying in the supine position should be avoided owing to the possibility of supine hypotension. Sitting up or lateral positions are preferable and may be more comfortable. 4 It is not possible to examine FHR unless an audible fetal heart signal is detected. The fetal pulse can be distinguished from the maternal pulse by feeling the mother’s pulse during the examination.
