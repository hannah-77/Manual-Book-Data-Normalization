    "3.2 Overview": "15.3.1 Introduction DS001 with the TH module (Infrared Ear Temperature Module) takes a temperature in the Diagram of the Infrared Ear Thermometer: 1. The infrared ear thermometer is not intended for neonatal patients. 2. Only use the disposable probe covers supplied or recommended by RGB. Use of other manufacturer’s probe covers, reuse of disposable probe covers or absence of probe covers may produce temperature measurement errors and/or inaccuracies. 3. Keep the probe covers away from children. 4. Do not reuse the disposable probe covers. 5. This thermometer converts the ear temperature to display its ‘oral equivalent’ (according to the result of the clinical evaluation to get the offset value). The thermometer is adjusted to display an oral temperature equivalent. Oral Mode = Ear Mode + 0.30 °C. 1. Keep the probe window clean, dry, and undamaged at times to ensure accurate measurements. To protect the probe window, always keep the thermometer in the storage cover while transporting or when not in use. 2. Proper installation of the probe cover ensures accurate measurements. 3. Do not autoclave. 4. The probe should not be submerged into liquids. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring TEMP 5. Keep the unit dry and away from any liquids and direct sunlight. 6. The thermometer is not waterproof. Do not immerse or drip fluids on it. Should this occur, dry the thermometer with warm air. Check for proper operation and accuracy. 7. Holding the thermometer too long may cause a higher ambient temperature reading of the probe, which could make the body temperature measurements lower than usual. 8. For more details about using the infrared ear thermometer, refer to the accompanying operating instructions of the thermometer. 9. Check whether the thermometer is damaged once it drops. If you cannot make sure of it, send the complete device to your local dealer for recalibration. 10. The monitor outfitted with the TH module must not be used together with other electrosurgery equipment, for example, ESU. 11. Remove the batteries from TH module if TH module is not used for a longer period of 12. Verification of the temperature module is necessary as frequently as dictated by your Hospital Procedures Policy. When you need to calibrate the temperature measurement, please contact the manufacturer. 15.3.2 Measuring Procedure 1. Align the center of the probe to the center of the probe cover. Make sure to place the adhesive side of probe cover upward. 2. Insert the probe into the probe cover on the probe cover loader until the probe cover clicks in place. If the probe cover did not install well, the icon will flash on the LCD of the thermometer, and you cannot take the ear temperature (with four beep sounds heard and without reading on the LCD when measuring). 3. Press ON/MEM button of the thermometer. The icon will display on the LCD of the thermometer and you will hear two beep sounds. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring TEMP 4. Gently pull the ear back to straighten the ear canal and snugly fit the probe into the ear canal, aiming towards the membrane of the eardrum to obtain an accurate reading. For children over two-year old and adults: pull the ear straight up and back as shown 5. Press the “Scan” button for one second until you hear a long beep sound which signals the end of the measurement, and results will be shown on the display of the monitor. 6. Before starting another measurement, wait until all icons stop flashing and two beep sounds are heard. Replace the probe cover after each use to ensure an accurate reading and avoid cross contamination. 1 The thermometer will automatically shut down after one-minute pending to extend battery life. 2 The device must stay in stable ambient (room) temperature for 30 minutes before operation. 3 Before the measurement, please stay in a stable environment for five minutes and avoid exercise or bath for 30 minutes. 4 It is recommended that you measure the same ear for three times. If the three measurements are different, select the highest temperature. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring TEMP 5 Remember to compare the measurement result to the regular temperature of the patient. 6 There is no gender and age limitation for using infrared ear thermometer. 7 The data saved in the thermometer is the last measurement data before the thermometer is powered off. 8 Clinical repeatability: 0.12 C (1~5 years old); 0.10 C (>5 years old). 9 The infrared ear thermometer will also give error messages on its screen. For details about the error messages, refer to the accompanying operating instructions of the thermometer. 10 If the infrared ear thermometer frequently signals ERR alarms, the insulated board inside the thermometer housing is malfunctioning or the ambient temperature changes, and the monitor will delete the measurement values onscreen to avoid misoperation. 15.3.3 Replacing the Battery The device is supplied with one lithium cell CR2032x1. To replacing the battery, follow the procedure: 1. Open the battery cover by inserting a pointed object into the battery cover pin hole; meanwhile, use thumb to push battery cover out. 2.

Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Testing Blood Glucose Chapter 16 Monitoring FHR (Optional) 16.1 Overview The monitor can measure FHR by connecting to DP1 Ultrasonic Pocket Doppler (hereafter called DP1) through E-Link. It can be used for measuring FHR for adult patients in ward round mode or spot-checking mode. 16.2 FHR Safety Information 15. Before DP1 is prescribed for home use, the user (patient) must be instructed/trained in proper use of the equipment. 16. Home fetal heart rate detection has not been shown to prevent the onset of preterm labor nor will it prevent the occurrence of preterm birth. 17. The DP1 is a tool to aid the user in hospitals, clinics or at home and should not be used in place of normal fetal detection. It is not intended for treatment or use during labor and delivery. 18. Placement of the ultrasound transducer on the abdomen is critical to obtaining the fetal heart beat as opposed to maternal heart beat or other abdominal noise. The user should be trained in proper placement techniques either through acceptable Ob/Gyn training and individual state accreditation, or as being prescribed by such a trained clinician and trained in device placement. 19. We recommend that exposure to ultrasound should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This is considered to be good practice and should be observed at all time. 20. The device is not protected against defibrillation. 21. DP1 complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:  this device may not cause harmful interference, and  this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation. 22. DP1 is designed to detect the fetal heartbeat from the 10th week of gestation. 23. Before applying DP1 to inspect FHR, you should always check whether the DP1 is in good condition and whether there is evident damage that might affect patient’s safety and the device’s function. If evident damage is found, stop using it at once and replace it with a good one. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Testing Blood Glucose 1. The DP1’s degree of protection against harmful ingress of water is IP22. Do not immerse it in water. 2. The DP1 is delicate and sensitive. Please handle it with care and try to avoid dropping on to the ground or any hard surfaces. Any damage caused by dropping is not covered by the warranty. 3. Keep the coupling gel away from children. If swallowed, consult a physician at once. 1 The best quality of fetal heart signal is obtained only when DP1 is placed in the best detection position. 2 Do not place DP1 near positions where placental sound or umbilical blood flow sound is loud. 3 If the fetus is in the cephalic position and the mother is supine, the clearest heart sound will normally be found on the midline below the navel. During detection, the pregnant woman’s prolonged lying in the supine position should be avoided to reduce the possibility of supine hypotension. Putting a pillow or cushion under the patient’s head or feet can be of help. 4 It is not possible to obtain accurate FHR unless a clear fetal heart signal is detected. If the calculated FHR is not in accordance with the beat of the fetal heart sound, the fetal heart sound auscultation result shall prevail. 5 When applied to the patient, the Doppler may warm slightly (less than 2 °C (35.6 °F) above ambient temperature). When NOT applied, the Doppler may slightly (less than 5 °C (41 °F) above ambient temperature). 16.3 Connecting DP1 to the Monitor 1. Turn on the monitor, select Menu > User Maintain > Network > E-Link, set the E-Link to Active Connection, and then turn off the monitor to make the setting effect. 2. Select System Setup > E-Link to pair the DP1 with the monitor. After successfully pairs, DP1 will be shown in Paired Devices.

High level alarms A high level alarm intensively warns the operator of a high priority alarm condition which requires immediate operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in death or irreversible injury of the patient. 2. Medium level alarms A medium level alarm warns the operator of a medium priority alarm condition which requires prompt operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in reversible injury of the patient. 3. Low level alarms A low level alarm reminds the operator of a low priority alarm condition which requires response. And the response time for a low priority alarm condition can be greater than that for a medium priority alarm condition. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in discomfort or reversible minor injury of the patient. The high/medium/low-level alarms are indicated by the system in following different ways: Alarm level Prompt High Mode is “DO-DO-DO------DO-DO, DO-DO-DO------DO-DO”, which is triggered once every 8-10 seconds. The alarm indicator flashes in red, with frequency of 1.4 Hz～2.8 Hz. The alarm message flashes with red background, and the symbol *** is displayed at the alarm Medium Mode is “DO-DO-DO”, which is triggered once every 23-25 seconds. The alarm indicator flashes in yellow, with frequency of 0.4 Hz～0.8 Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Alarms Hz. The alarm message flashes with yellow background, and the symbol ** is displayed at the alarm area. Low Mode is “DO-”, which is triggered once every 28-30 seconds. When physiological alarm is triggered, the alarm indicator is constantly yellow. While for technical alarm, the alarm indicator is constantly blue. The alarm message flashes with yellow background, and the symbol * is displayed at the alarm area. The sound pressure range for standard audible alarm signals is from 45 dB to 85 dB. When different level alarms occur at the same time, alarm sound and alarm indicator prompt the highest level alarm, alarm messages display in turn. The parameter area has two flash methods to prompt alarms: background flash and text flash. User can click respective parameter area to enter parameter setup menu > Alarm > Visual Effect: 1. Text Flash: text flashes with frequency of 1 Hz. 2. Background Flash: background flashes with frequency of 1 Hz. 1. Do not rely exclusively on the audible alarm system for patient monitoring. Adjustment of alarm volume to a low level or off during patient monitoring may result in patient danger. Remember that the most reliable method of patient monitoring combines close personal surveillance with correct operation of monitoring equipment. 2. Ensure the volume is properly set up. When the sound pressure of audible alarm is below or equivalent to the ambient noise, it may be difficult for the operator to distinguish the audio alarm. 9.3 Controlling Alarm 9.3.1 Setting Parameter Alarm In monitor mode, parameter alarm settings including alarm switch, alarm record, alarm level and alarm limit are available on the respective alarm setup menu for each parameter.

Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO Chapter 12 Monitoring SpO 12.1 Overview SpO is used to measure arterial blood oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of oxyhemoglobin in the arterial blood. SpO parameter can also provide pulse rate (PR), Respiration Rate (RR) and a plethysmogram wave (Pleth). 12.2 SpO Safety Information 1. Do not use the SpO2 sensors if the packaging or the sensor is damaged and return them to the vendor. 2. If the SpO2 sensor cannot work properly, please reconnect the sensor or change a 3. Correct and proper sensor application: if the sensor is too loose, it might compromise the optical alignment, and even cause the sensor to fall off. If the sensor is too tight, (such as the application site is too large or becomes too large due to edema), excessive pressure and local tissue ischemia, hypoxia and lack of nutrition may occur on the application site. Prolonged and continuous monitoring may increase the risk of Skin irritations or lacerations. To avoid these damages, users should periodically check surrounding skin of application site according to the patient's condition and pressure sensor, inspect the if there is sign of stress-related damage in surrounding tissue, and regularly change the application site. For the patients whose fluid is easy to transfer and/or the patients with systemic or localized edema, users should inspect the skin and change application site more frequently. 4. Use only RGB permitted sensors and extension cables with the monitor. Other sensors or extension cables may cause improper monitor performance and/or minor personal 5. High oxygen levels may predispose a premature infant to retrolental fibroplasia. If this is a consideration do NOT set the high alarm limit to 100%, which is equivalent to switching the high limit alarm off. 6. When serious arrhythmia is present, the SpO2 pulse rate may differ from ECG heart rate but this does not indicate an inaccurate PR (SpO2) value. 7. Misapplied sensor or sensor that becomes partially dislodged may cause either over or under reading of actual arterial oxygen saturation. 8. The Respiration rate monitoring is not applicable to neonate patients. When monitoring respiration rate, the patient should be quiet, motionless and calm. 9. Optical, pleth-based measurements (SpO2 and RR) can be affected by the following: Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO  Improper sensor application or use of incorrect sensor.  NIBP cuff applied to the same arm as the sensor site.  Intravascular dyes such as indocyanine green or methylene blue.  Venous congestion.  Abnormal venous pulsations (e.g. tricuspid value regurgitation, Trendelenburg  Abnormal pulse rhythms due to physiological conditions or induced through external factors (e.g. cardiac arrhythmias, intra-aortic balloon, etc.).  Externally applied coloring and texture such as nail polish, acrylic nails, glitter, etc.  Moisture, birthmarks, skin discoloration, nail aberration, deformed fingers, or foreign objects in the light path.  Elevated levels of bilirubin.  Physiological conditions that can significantly shift the oxygen disassociation curve.  A physiological condition that may effect vasomotor tone or changes in vasomotor 10. Inaccurate RR measurements may be caused by:  Low arterial perfusion.  Motion induced artifact.  Severe anemia.  Arrhythmia 1 Avoid placing the sensor on extremities with an arterial catheter, intravascular venous infusion line, or inflated NIBP cuff. When measuring SpO on the limb with inflated NIBP cuff, please turn on the NIBP Simul function. 2 When a trend toward patient deoxygenation is indicated, analyze the blood samples with a laboratory co-oximeter to completely understand the patient’s condition. 3 SpO waveform is not directly proportional to the pulse volume. 4 The device is calibrated to display functional oxygen saturation. 5 Functional tester or simulator cannot be used to assess the SpO accuracy. However, it can be used to demonstrate that a particular monitor reproduces a Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO calibration curve that has been independently demonstrated to meet a particular 6 If the surrounding temperature increases, the operator should pay attention to the site of poor perfusion, and increase the frequency of checking the skin and changing the measurement site to prevent burns. If the initial skin temperature is less than 35 °C, the temperature of all the listed sensors on the skin will not exceed 41 °C during working. 7 The cumulative use time for SpO sensor in a single patient should be less than 8 The first RR was measured within 30 seconds. 12.3 Measuring SpO 1. Select the correct patient category setting (adult/pediatric and neonatal), as this is used to optimize the calculation of the SpO and pulse numerics. 2. During measurement, ensure that the application site: – has a pulsatile flow, ideally with a good circulation perfusion. – has not changed in its thickness, causing an improper fit of the sensor. Measurement Procedure 1. Switch on the monitor. 2. Attach the sensor to the appropriate site of the patient. Before Applying the Sensor Be sure to understand all warnings listed in the previous section before applying any sensor to a patient. Also,check the sensor as follows:  Check the sensor outside and inside. To inspect the inside, gently open the sensor cavity and check splits on or next to the transparent silicone that covers the optical elements.  Any sensor showing signs of damage or alteration must not be used for further patient monitoring; instead, dispose of it using proper disposal procedures. Applying Finger/Soft-tip Sensors:  Nip the clamp, and choose a site that is well perfused and restricts a conscious patient’s movements least. The right finger of the non-dominate hand is preferred. Alternatively, the other digits on the non-dominate hand may be used.  The grate toe or long toe (next to the grate toe) may be used on restrained patients or patients whose hands are unavailable. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO  Place the finger into the sensor according to the direction of the symbol on the sensor. The fleshiest part of digit should be covering the detector window.  Orient the sensor so that the cable will be running towards the top of the patient’s hand.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). Applying Neonatal Finger (or Toe) Wrap Sensors:  When you perform the measurement, position the sensor over the hand or foot with optical components opposite each other.  Hold the sensor, and insert stretched strap into slot, hold it there while threading end through latch. If strap is too long, thread it through second latch.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). Applying Adult/Pediatric Ear Clip Sensor:  When you perform the measurement, clip the plastic fixing mechanism on top of the ear; make the ear afford the sensor’s weight to avoid the sensor getting loose.  Clip the probe onto fleshy part of the lobe with optical components opposite to each other.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). 3. Plug the connector of the sensor extension cable into the SpO socket. 1. Inspect the application site every two to three hours to ensure skin quality and correct optical alignment. If the skin quality changes, move the sensor to another site. Change the application site at least every four hours. 2. For neonate, change the measuring site every 20 minutes. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO 1 Injected dyes such as methylene blue or intravascular dyshemoglobins such as methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin may lead to inaccurate measurements. 2 Inspect the sensor to ensure that the light emitter and receiver are aligned with each other and there is no gap between the sensor and the finger. All the light emitted by the light emitter must pass through the patient's tissue. The sensor cable should be placed on the back of the hand. 3 Clean and remove any substances such as nail polish from the application site. Periodically check to ensure that the sensor remains properly positioned on the 12.4 Measurement Limitations Certain patient conditions can affect the measurements or cause the loss of the pulse signal. Inaccurate measurements can be caused but not limited by: • incorrect sensor application • high levels of ambient light sources, such as surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, and direct • failure to cover the sensor with opaque material in high levels of ambient light conditions • dysfunctional hemoglobins • low peripheral perfusion • excessive or violent patient movement • venous pulsations • intravascular dyes, such as indocyanine green or methylene blue • externally applied coloring agents (nail polish, dye, pigmented cream) • defibrillation • placement of the sensor on an extremity with a blood pressure cuff, arterial catheter, or intravascular line • electromagnetic interference Loss of pulse signal can occur for the following reasons: • the sensor is applied too tightly • a blood pressure cuff is inflated on the same extremity as the one with the sensor • there is arterial occlusion proximal to the sensor • low peripheral perfusion Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO 1 To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the sensor is properly applied, and cover the sensor site with opaque material. 2 Adjacent SpO sensors may interfere with each other (eg, multiple SpO measurements in the same patient). Be sure to cover the sensor with opaque material to reduce cross-interference. 3 Move the sensor to a less active site, and keep the patient still, if possible. 4 For Nellcor SpO module, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required for measuring SpO and PR depending on the measurement conditions. During normal measurement conditions the averaging time is 6 to 7 seconds. During conditions such as those caused by low perfusion, interference (e.g., external interference such as ambient light or patient movement), or a combination of these, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required beyond 7 seconds. If the resulting dynamic averaging time exceeds 20 seconds, the screen will display prompt message “SpO Search Pulse” and SpO and PR will continue to be updated every second. As these conditions extend, the amount of data required continues to increase. If the dynamic averaging time reaches 40 seconds, the screen will display high-level alarm message “SpO No Pulse” indicating a loss-of-pulse condition. 12.5 Assessing the Validity of a SpO Reading You can check the quality of the pleth wave and the stability of the SpO values to assess whether the sensor functions properly and whether the SpO readings are valid. Always use these two indications simultaneously to assess the validity of a SpO reading. Generally, the quality of the SpO pleth wave reflects the quality of the light signals obtained by the sensor. A wave of poor quality manifests a decline of the signal validity. On the other hand, the stability of the SpO values also reflects the signal quality. Different from varying SpO readings caused by physiological factors, unstable SpO readings are resulted from the sensor’s receiving signals with interference. The problems mentioned above may be caused by patient movement, wrong sensor placement or sensor malfunction. To obtain valid SpO readings, try to limit patient movement, check the placement of the sensor, measure another site or replace the sensor. 1 The SpO accuracy has been validated in controlled human studies against arterial blood sample reference measured with a CO-oximeter. SpO measurements are statistically distributed, only about two-thirds of the Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO measurements can be expected to fall within the specified accuracy compared to CO-oximeter measurements. The volunteer population in the studies are composed of healthy men and women from 18 to 50, with various skin pigmentations. Note that the study population was healthy adults and not in the actual intended use population. 2 The pulse rate accuracy is obtained by comparison to the pulse rate generated with an arterial oxygen simulator (also an electronic pulse simulator). 3 During monitoring, if the monitor's reading differs significantly from the patient's physiological condition, it indicates that the signal may be disturbed, resulting in an inaccurate reading. In this case, the artifact can disguise as a similar reading, causing the monitor to fail to send an alarm. In order to ensure reliable monitoring, it is necessary to regularly check whether the sensor is wearing properly and the signal quality is good. 12.6 SpO Alarm Delay There is a delay between a physiological event at the measurement site and the corresponding alarm at the monitor. This delay has two components: 1. The time between the occurrence of the physiological event and when this event is represented by the displayed numerical values. This delay depends on the algorithmic processing time and the sensitivity setting. The lower the sensitivity configured, the longer the time needed until the numerical values reflect the physiological event. 2. The time between the displayed numerical values exceeding an alarm limit and the alarm indication on the monitor. This delay is the combination of the configured alarm delay time plus the general system delay time. 12.7 Perfusion Index (PI)* * Only applicable to the RGB SpO module. PI is a numeric value indicating perfusion level. It reflects the perfusion level at the monitoring site. As the measurement of SpO is based on the pulsation caused by the blood flow through the vessel, PI is in relation to the strength of the pulse. Also, you can use PI as a signal quality indicator for the measurement of SpO . PI is indicated by a value ranging from 0 to 10. The bigger the value is, the better the perfusion and the signal quality will be. The perfusion level and the signal quality are at their maximum when the value reaches 10. When PI is below 2, it indicates the low perfusion and the poor signal quality at the monitoring site; you need to reposition the sensor or find a better site. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO The PI value will be displayed in the SpO parameter area. 12.8 Setting Pitch Tone If tone modulation is on, the PR sound lowers when the SpO level drops. In the SpO Setup menu, select pitch tone to toggle between On and Off. The lower SpO value is, the lower the frequency of Pitch tone is. 12.9 Setting Sensitivity The different sensitivity indicates different refresh frequency. High indicates the refresh frequency of SpO value is the most frequent. To change the sensitivity, please follow the 1 Select the SpO Setup menu; 2 Select Sensitivity on the interface and select the desired sensitivity from the popup list. 12.10 Measuring SpO and NIBP Simultaneously While measuring SpO and NIBP on the same limb simultaneously, the user can enter SpO Setup > NIBP Simul to choose ON or OFF. t1~t2 is the duration time of NIBP/SpO Simul measurement. T1 and t2 respectively means beginning and ending (cuff deflation over) NIBP measurement. When NIBP/SpO Simul measurement is set to on: • General information area displays NIBP Simul; • During t1~t2: in monitor mode, there are no SpO and PR (when PR is from SpO ) physiological alarms; in Ward round or spot-checking mode, there are no SpO and PR (when PR is from SpO ) alert information; • Before t1 and after t2, there are normal SpO physiological alarms/alert information and PR physiological alarms/alert information; • It will not influence other functions of the monitor. 12.11 SatSeconds Alarm Management* * Only applicable to the Nellcor SpO module. 12.11.1 Describing SatSeconds With traditional alarm management, upper and lower alarm limits are set for monitoring oxygen saturation. During monitoring, as soon as an alarm limit is violated by as little as one percentage point, an alarm is immediately triggered. When the SpO level fluctuates near an alarm limit, the alarm is triggered each time the limit is violated. Such frequent alarms can be distracting. With the SatSeconds technique, upper and lower SpO alarm limits are set in the same way as traditional alarm management. However, you can also set a SatSeconds limit that allows monitoring of SpO below the selected lower alarm limit and above the selected upper alarm limit for a period of time before an alarm is triggered. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO The method of calculation is as follows: The number of percentage points that the SpO falls outside the alarm limit is multiplied by the number of seconds that the SpO level remains outside that limit. This can be stated as an equation: Points × Seconds = SatSeconds Where: Points = SpO percentage points outside of the limit Seconds = number of seconds that SpO remains at that point outside of the limit The alarm response time, assuming a SatSeconds limit set at 50 and a lower alarm limit set at 90, is described and illustrated below. In this example, the SpO level drops to 88 (2 points below the limit) and remains there for a period of 2 seconds (2 points × 2 seconds = 4 SatSeconds). The SpO then drops to 86 for 3 seconds and then to 84 for 6 seconds. The resulting SatSeconds values are shown Seconds SatSeconds 4 × 3 = 12 6 × 6 = 36 Total SatSeconds = 52 After approximately 10.7 seconds, a SatSeconds alarm will be triggered, because the limit of 50 SatSeconds has been exceeded. See arrow (↑) in the following figure. Alarm Response with SatSeconds Saturation levels may fluctuate rather than remaining steady for a period of several seconds. Often, the patient SpO may fluctuate above and below the alarm limit, re-entering the non- alarm range several times. During such fluctuation, the monitor integrates the number of SpO points, both positive and negative, until either the SatSeconds limit is reached, or the patient SpO returns within a normal range and remains there. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring SpO 12.11.2 SatSeconds “Safety Net” The SatSeconds “Safety Net” is for patients whose saturation makes frequent excursions below or above the SpO limit but does not remain in violation long enough for the SatSeconds limit to be reached. If three or more SpO alarm limit violations occur within a 60-second period, an alarm will be triggered even if the SatSeconds limit has not been 12.11.3 Setting SatSeconds Duration You can set SatSeconds to Off or to the duration among 10, 25, 50 and 100. To configure the SatSeconds settings, enter the SpO Setup menu and select the desired SatSeconds setting from the SatSeconds list. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring PR Chapter 13 Monitoring PR 13.1 Overview The pulse numeric counts the arterial pulsations that result from the mechanical activity of the heart in beats per minute (bpm). You can obtain a pulse from any measured SpO signal or NIBP measurement. 13.2 PR Source In spot-checking mode or ward round mode, PR source can be from SpO or NIBP, and is not selectable. SpO is preferred source if PR from SpO is valid. In monitoring mode, PR source is fixed from SpO . If PR is on, and SpO & NIBP both are off, PR parameter area will display No source. 13.3 Setting PR Volume Select Function in PR Setup menu, then select the appropriate setting for the PR volume: five bars represent the maximum volume and one bar represents the minimum volume. If none of bars are selected, the PR volume will be off. Beat frequency has positive correlation with measurement value. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP Chapter 14 Monitoring NIBP 14.1 Overview This monitor uses the oscillometric method for measuring NIBP. It can be used for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients. It is also intended for use with pregnant, including pre- eclamptic patients. iCUFS algorithm: Oscillometric devices measure the amplitude of pressure changes in the occluding cuff as the cuff deflates from above systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks through the occlusion in the artery. As the cuff pressure decreases further, the pulsations increase in amplitude, reach a maximum (which approximates to the mean pressure), and then diminish. The oscillometric method measures the mean pressure and determines the systolic and diastolic pressures. iFAST algorithm: During the cuff inflation, oscillometric devices detect the change of pulsation amplitude due to the cuff pressure change. The pulsations increase in amplitude and reach a maximum (which approximates to the mean pressure). The oscillometric method measures the mean pressure and determines the systolic and diastolic pressures. Oscillometric devices terminate the NIBP measurement and deflate quickly once the systolic pressure is determined. The blood pressure measurements determined with this device comply with the American National Standard for Electronic or Automated Sphygmomanometers (ISO 81060-2) in relation to mean error and standard deviation. In clinical investigation method with a reference sphygmomanometer, the fifth Korotkoff sound was used to determine adult diastolic pressure, and the fourth Korotkoff sound was used to determine pediatric diastolic pressure. The invasive blood pressure is used to determine the neonate pressure in clinical investigation, and the arterial reference sites include umbilical artery, arteria cruralis, axillary artery, brachial artery, dorsalis pedis, and radial artery. When selecting the patient type on the patient admitting interface, it is recommended to choose Adult for patients greater than 21 years of age, Pediat for patients greater than 3 through 21 years of age and Neonat for patients from birth through 3 years of age. 14.2 NIBP Safety Information 3. Do not measure NIBP on patients with sickle-cell disease or any condition where skin damage has occurred or is expected. 4. Do not measure NIBP on the arm of the same side with a mastectomy. 5. Use clinical judgment to decide whether to perform frequent blood pressure measurements on patients with severe blood clotting disorders because of the risk of hematoma in the limb fitted with the cuff. 6. Do not apply the cuff to a limb that has an intravenous infusion or catheter in place. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when infusion is slowed or blocked during cuff inflation. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP 7. Do not attach the cuff to a limb being used for IV infusions as the cuff inflation can block the infusion, potentially causing harm to patient. 8. Make sure that the air conduit connecting the blood pressure cuff and the monitor is neither blocked nor tangled. 9. Do not apply the cuff to a limb where intravascular access or therapy, or an arterio- venous (A-V) shunt is present, otherwise, it may result in injury to the patient. 10. Ensure that the correct patient type is selected before performing measurements. Do not apply the higher adult inflation, overpressure limits and measurement duration for neonatal patients. Not using the neonate mode on a neonatal patient can block the blood flow, potentially causing harm to the patient. 11. Measuring of blood pressure can temporarily cause malfunctioning of other medical monitoring devices on the same limb. 12. NIBP readings can be affected by the measurement site, the position of the patient, exercise, or the patient's physiologic conditions. 13. Continuous cuff pressure due to connection tubing kinking can block the blood flow, and may result in injury to the patient. 14. Verifying the calibration is only applicable for adults, and it cannot be operated in automatic measuring interval. Continuous measuring cannot be operated in automatic measuring interval either. 1 It is suggested that the user should not start NIBP measuring when the low battery displays, or the monitor may be turned off automatically. 2 If you spill liquid onto the equipment or accessories, particularly if there is a chance that it can get inside the tubing or the measurement device, contact your service personnel. 3 Continuous use of the automatic measuring mode for short intervals may lead to the discomfort of patient. Continuous measuring and automatic measuring in neonatal or pediatric mode may result in tissue damage or ischemia to the patient. 4 NIBP measurement can be affected by extremes of temperature, humidity and 5 NIBP measurement value should be explained by qualified professionals. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP 6 The pulse rate based on the NIBP measurement may differ from the heart rate based on the ECG waveform. NIBP measures the number of peripheral pulse pulsations, and the heart rate is measured by the electrical signal of the heart. When the electrical signals of the heart occasionally fail to cause the peripheral blood vessels to pulse or the patient's peripheral perfusion is poor, the difference 7 The cumulative use time for NIBP cuff in a single patient should be less than 30 8 iFAST algorithm is applicable to adults and pediatrics. 14.3 Measurement Limitations Measurements are impossible with pulse rate extremes of less than 40 bpm or greater than 240 bpm, or if the patient is on a heart-lung machine. The measurement may be inaccurate or impossible in the following situations:  A regular arterial pressure pulse is hard to detect.  Patients with cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients with excessive and continuous movement such as shivering or convulsions. Patients with rapid blood pressure changes.  Patients with severe shock or hypothermia that reduces blood flow to the peripheries.  Patients with obesity, where a thick layer of fat surrounding a limb dampens the oscillations coming from the artery.  Patients on an edematous extremity. 14.4 Measurement Methods There are four methods of measuring NIBP:  Manual - measurement on demand. Manual is the default setting in Ward round and spot-checking mode.  Auto - continually repeated measurements (between 1 and 480 minute adjustable interval). After the first measurement starts manually, the monitor will automatically measure NIBP as preset interval. Auto is used in monitor mode only.  Continual- the measurement will run consecutively in five minutes with intervals of 5 seconds, then the monitor enters manual mode or auto mode.  Average – between 1 and 5 minute adjustable AVG interval, measurement will run as specified AVG times (3 or 5 times are optional), then gets average value. Average is used in Ward round or spot-checking mode only. After finishing average measurement, the monitor enters manual mode. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP To change Measure Mode, Interval, AVG Measurement Interval and AVG Measurement Times, please select NIBP Setup > Function. Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurements in Auto mode may be associated with purpura, ischemia and neuropathy in the limb wearing the cuff. 14.5 Measurement Procedures To obtain accurate measurements, the following operating steps need to be observed: 1. Ensure the patient position in normal use, including  Comfortably seated or lie flat, legs uncrossed;  Feet flat on the floor  Back and arm supported  During the measurement, relax as much as possible, neither talking nor applying external pressure against the cuff. Rest for five minutes in a quiet environment. 2. Connect the air hose and switch on the monitor. Apply the blood pressure cuff to the patient's arm and follow the instructions below. Ensure that middle of the cuff is at the level of the right atrium of the heart and the cuff is completely deflated. Apply the appropriate size cuff to the patient (About the cuff size selection, please refer to Section NIBPaccessories), and make sure that the symbol \"Φ\" is over the artery. Ensure that the cuff is not wrapped too tightly around the limb. Excessive tightness may cause discoloration and eventual ischemia of the extremity. Cuff Usage 3. Check whether the patient type is appropriately selected. Clicking patient information area or pressing Switch Patient Type hardkey can change patient Type. 4. Select a measurement mode and unit (mmHg, cmH O or kPa, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa, 1 mmHg=1.36 cmH O) in the NIBP Setup menu. Refer to section Operation Prompts for details. 5. Press the button on the front panel to start a measurement. 6. Wait until the first reading is taken. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP 1 The width of the cuff is either approximately 40% of the limb circumference or 2/3 of the upper arm length. The inflatable part of the cuff should be long enough to encircle 80-100% of the limb. The wrong size of cuff can cause erroneous readings. If the cuff size is in question, use another cuff with suitable size to avoid errors. 2 If an NIBP measurement is suspect, repeat the measurement. If you are still uncertain about the reading, use another method to measure the blood pressure. 3 Please make sure the cuff is well connected. A leak of air may cause measurement error. 4 Please select the cuff with the suitable size. An unsuitable cuff may cause incorrect measurements. 5 Avoid incursion of liquid into the cuff. If this happens, please desiccate the cuff completely. 6 NIBP parameter area can display real-time cuff pressure value till displaying SYS 7 NIBP parameter area keeps measured value for 30 mins.

When the pressure does not work properly and the system fails to give a message for the problem, pick Reset in the User Maintain > NIBP menu to activate self-test procedure, and thus restore the system from abnormal performance. 14.8 Calibrating NIBP NIBP is not user-calibrated. Cuff-pressure transducers must be verified and calibrated, if necessary, at least once every two years by a qualified service professional. See the Service Manual for details. 14.9 Leakage Test Leakage test is used to detect the air tightness of the NIBP pump, valve, and trachea. If not, the system will display NIBP leakage. NIBP leak detection should be performed at least once every two years or when you think the measurement is inaccurate. This leakage test other than being specified in the ISO 81060-1 standard is to be used by the user to simply determine whether there are air leaks in the NIBP airway. If at the end of the test the system gives the prompt that the NIBP airway has air leaks, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Procedure of Leakage Test 1. Connect the cuff securely with the socket for NIBP air hole. 2. Wrap the cuff around the cylinder of an appropriate size; don’t wrap the cuff around 3. Make sure the patient type has been set to Adult. 4. Access Menu > User Maintain. Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring NIBP 5. Select Leakage Test in NIBP. Then the prompt Leak. Test Running will appear indicating that the system has started the leakage test. For RGB module: The system will automatically inflate the pneumatic system to about 180 mmHg. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, if system leakage has detected, the system will automatically open the deflating valve to stop the leak test and indicates NIBP Leak. If no system leakage is detected when the pneumatic system is inflated to 180 mmHg, the system will perform a deflation to an approximate value of 40 mmHg and subsequently perform the second phase leak test. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, the system will automatically open the deflating valve and provide corresponding indication based on the test result. For SunTech module: When applying high pressures; take special care to increase the pressure at a rate that will not cause unwanted overpressure errors (300 mmHg). Manually inflate the pneumatic system to approximately 250 mmHg. Start the timer and wait 60 seconds for the pneumatic system to reach its pressure equilibrium point. After the waiting period, record the pneumatic pressure level (P1) and wait another 60 seconds and record the pneumatic pressure level again (P2). Safety circuitry on the module only allows the pressure in the pneumatic system to remain above 10mmHg for 180 seconds. When this safety time limit is exceeded, the valves will open releasing the pressure. Subtract P2 from P1 and this is the leak rate per minute. 6. If the alarm information NIBP Leak appears, it indicates that the airway may have air leaks. In this case, the user should check for loose connection. After confirming secure connections, the user should re-perform the leakage test. If the failure prompt still appears, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Diagram of NIBP Air Leakage Test 14.10 Setting Inflation Value To change the inflation value: 1. Select NIBP Setup > Function > Inflation value; 2.

Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring TEMP Chapter 15 Monitoring TEMP 15.1 Quick TEMP with T2A Module (Optional) 15.1.1 Introduction DS001 with the T2A module takes a temperature in either Predict or Monitor Mode. In the Predict mode, the monitor measures oral/axillary/rectal TEMP in a short time, calculates and gets the measuring results. In Monitor mode, it can monitor patient for 10 min. The Oral/Axillary sensor and Rectal sensor are of standard configuration. The monitor can only measure temperature of adult and pediatric (not neonatal) patients. Making a TEMP Measurement  Select the correct sensor according to the measuring position and patient type.  Apply the sensor to the patient. You are advised to use a protective rubber cover on  Ensure the alarm settings (on or off, higher alarm or lower alarm limit) are appropriate for the patient and the type of temperature measurement.  Select the correct measuring position in menu.  Switch on the monitor. It takes 5 min for the body temperature to stabilize. 1. To ensure optimal accuracy, always confirm that the correct mode and alarm limit are selected. Changing the measure position may lead to the change of alarm limit. 2. Verify probe cables fault detection before the beginning of monitoring phase. Unplug the temperature probe cable from the socket, and then the screen will display the error message TEMP SENSOR OFF and the audible alarm is activated. 3. Take the TEMP probe and cable carefully. When they are not in use, you should coil up the probe and cable into a loose circle. If the wire inside the cable is tensely pulled, it may cause mechanical damage to the probe and the cable. 4. Verification of the temperature module is necessary as frequently as dictated by your Hospital Procedures Policy. When you need to calibrate the temperature measurement, please contact the manufacturer. 5. Patient actions may interfere with accurate oral temperature readings. Ingesting hot or cold liquids, eating food, chewing gum or mints, brushing teeth, smoking or performing strenuous activity may affect temperature readings for up to 20min after activity has Medical Diagnostic Station - DS001 Monitoring TEMP 6. Do not take an axillary temperature through patient’s clothing. Direct probe cover to skin contact is required. 7. Biting the sensor tip while taking a temperature may result in damage to the sensor. 8. Use disposable TEMP sensor covers recommended by RGB to limit patient cross- contamination. The use of any other probe cover may produce temperature measurement errors or result in inaccurate readings. 9. Temp measurement isn’t suitable for use during defibrillation. 10. In monitoring mode, no physiological alarms are available. 15.1.2 Measuring Procedure Ensure the sensor is well installed.
