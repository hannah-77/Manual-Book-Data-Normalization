When the mains is abnormal, the battery will boost into the ±380V DC voltage for DC/AC inverter through DC/DC. The working principles of UPS 10K is as shown in Figure2-4. Maintenance Bypass Figure2-4 Working principle 2.4 Working Mode There are 4 work modes of the UPS: normal mains power supply mode, battery inverter mode, bypass power supply mode and maintenance bypass power supply mode. 2.4.1 Normal Mains Power Supply Mode When mains power is normal, the UPS works in mains inverter status and charge the battery at the same time. 2.4.2 Battery Inverter Mode When mains is abnormal, the rectifier will transfer to battery input immediately, boost the battery voltage and then maintain the voltage of DC bus voltage to guarantee the inverter output continuous. Before the battery stop discharging, if the mains recover normal, the rectifier will transfer to mains input automatically and charge the battery at the same time. That is to say, the UPS recover normal mains power supply mode. If the mains always abnormal and the battery is running up, the UPS will send sound alarm and stop working till battery low-voltage point. At that time, the buzzer long beeps to alarm, the power for load powers down. Under the circumstance of mains power outage completely, the UPS will shut down about 40S later automatically and close the power of the UPS to avoid the battery discharge slimly, thus to protect the service life of battery. Once the mains recover, the UPS will start automatically and turn to normal mains power supply mode. 2.4.3 Bypass Mode Under the circumstance of bypass voltage is normal, when UPS off or fault (such as inverter output overload, over-current surge or IGBT over-temperature etc.) while UPS on, the UPS will output by bypass. When UPS on and the fault removed, it will turn to inverter output 2.4.4 Maintenance Bypass Mode Only for UPS with maintenance bypass. When it needs to maintain UPS or replace battery, but it can't stop supplying power for load, switch off UPS and transfer to bypass mode, dismantle the maintenance bypass cover and transfer the maintenance bypass switch from maintenance bypass to bypass and then switch off mains breaker and in the rear panel of UPS. Now, AC power draws through maintenance bypass switch to supply power When UPS needs to be restored after finishing the maintenance, remove the load, switch off the external input breaker, and maintenance switch should be switched to the UPS gear after the device is powered off, and lock back the cover plate of maintenance bypass. Finally, restore UPS mains power supply and start work. In the maintenance bypass mode, there still exists electricity in the input terminals, output terminals, and the terminals in the filter 3 Installation This chapter mainly describes installation preparation, unpacking and checking, electrical connection, etc. 3.1 Installation Preparation 3.1.1 Installation Tools The installation tools must be with insulation protection to avoid electric shock.
