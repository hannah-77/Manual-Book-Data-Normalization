Any maintenance or renewal must be carried out by a trained person and an authorized professional from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. Maintenance must be done with original components from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. 11.2 Please pull out the power supply plug when the mains power is about to be turned off. If this sterilizer is not used for a long time, please unplug the power supply from the power source, then put this sterilizer in a shady, cool and dry place. 11.3 Ste releaseators should be regularly maintained and cleaned. How to clean the Elitech Sterilizer as follows: a.) First of all, the power cord must be disconnected from the power source. b.) Prepare a bucket and mix clean water and cleaning agents (liquid soap or neutral detergent) in the right ratio c.) Dip a sponge into the bucket and rub it on the outside and inside of the sterilizer chamber and instrument rack d.) Dip a cloth in a bucket filled with clean water without cleaning agents then rub it evenly throughout the sterilizer to remove foam and soap residue. e.) Use a dry and clean cloth to dry, until the whole Sterilizer is completely dry and clean Additional Chapter In practice, there is no special officer responsible for the decontamination action, all group members play a role in the sterilization and disinfection process. In the public health department, the implementing officers consist of: health supervisors, public health nurses, assistant nurses, midwives and public health doctors. In the surgical department, group members may consist of general practitioners, room nurses, head of the room, secretaries and receptionists. Routine tasks such as operating the Elitech Sterilizer can be left to someone else. In view of the above, it is necessary to provide the book \"Instructions for Using Sterilizers\" and if needed we can provide the book \" Practical Instructions for Instrument Sterilization with Elitech Sterilizers and Cross Infection Control\". First of all, it must be understood the meaning and difference of the terms decontamination, disinfection and sterilization. The degree of decontamination desired is determined by the risk posed by the instrument. Decontamination: A general term that describes the methods of washing, disinfection and sterilization to remove germs attached to medical equipment. Disinfection: A way to kill vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungi but not to kill Sterilization: A method to kill or destroy all microorganisms and spores attached to medical equipment. Often there is a misinterpretation of the term above, such as sterilizing with boiling hot water which does not kill all spores, viruses and bacteria. Pre-cleaning is an important part of the decontamination process; If the instrument is not cleaned and rinsed first, blood and other debris will clot and adhere firmly to the instrument. The attached organisms will prolong the decontamination or sterilization process. Elitech Sterilizing Cupboard / sterilizer brings new innovations in the medical world, in terms of sterilizing medical equipment. With simple technology we made a breakthrough in the field of sterilization of medical equipment. By applying very high concentrations of ozone gas for sterilization and very high intensity light.
