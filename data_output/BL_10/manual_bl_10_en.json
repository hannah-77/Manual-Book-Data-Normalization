    "3.2 Overview": "2 Overview The neonatal jaundice treatment instrument is suitable for light therapy of premature infants and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice is a common phenomenon in the neonatal period. It is observed that more than 90% of newborns can have different degrees of jaundice. It can be a physiological phenomenon in the newborn period (called physiological jaundice). It can also be an important symptom of many diseases in the neonatal period (called pathological jaundice). Because this pathological jaundice can cause bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) and cause brain damage in infants, leading to early death and serious sequelae, it is necessary to make timely and effective treatment of neonatal pathological The effect of light therapy on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (hyperbilirubinemia) is clinically recognized. The principle is that bilirubin can absorb light to produce photochemical isomerization, so that indirect bilirubin can be oxidized into a water-soluble product under the action of blue light. It is recognized by the medical community that phototherapy is an effective method for the treatment of neonatal pathological jaundice, and it is an indispensable medical device for every medical unit.

Manual Book Infant Phototherapy BL-10  Confirm that the jaundice treatment device can work normally. The light source can be bright, and the timer can count normally.  The jaundice treatment device should be used at an ambient temperature of +18℃~+30℃. It cannot be used in an environment with direct sunlight, strong electromagnetic fields or other radiation sources, otherwise it will affect the patient.  Nursing staff can adjust the irradiation treatment distance according to clinical needs, but the change of the distance will cause a certain degree of total irradiance on the crib surface. Impact.  To ensure the safety and effectiveness of phototherapy for patients, the distance between the radiation source of the jaundice lamp and the baby should be kept at 35cm Within ~50cm.  In order to achieve the best light treatment effect, it is necessary to ensure that the center point of the jaundice lamp radiation light source is in the same position as the center point of the baby's effective surface. A vertical line.  When used with incubators, baby radiant warmers or heated mattresses, it is recommended to use the skin control mode. Otherwise, according to body temperature  As a result, it is necessary to reduce the setting of the air temperature in the incubator or the setting of the heat output of the radiant warmer or the setting of the heat output of the heated mattress.  Put the naked patient on the effective surface of the crib. Manual Book Infant Phototherapy BL-10 Note: In order to achieve the best phototherapy effect, the patient must be completely within the effective surface. The area size of the effective surface The distance of the light source affects the average value of the total bilirubin irradiance, the larger the effective surface is, the smaller the average value, and the longer the distance, the smaller the average value; vice versa on the  Use protective devices to prevent patients from leaving the effective surface area, such as the crib baffle, the front door of the infant incubator, and regularly check the safety functions.  After the above operations are handled properly, the operator should promptly exit the area where the light can be irradiated to avoid long-term exposure to light radiation. If you need to When re-operation of the equipment or patient care/examination is required, the irradiating light source should not be looked directly at.  Turn on the power supply of the device and turn on the power switch of the device, and the device will begin to perform phototherapy on the patient. Note: The time of phototherapy should follow the instructions of the attending doctor.  Warm-up time is 5 hours, debugging time is 0.5 hours  The direct irradiation of the light source of the equipment will cause damage to the eyes of the patients, and the patients near the equipment and the patients during the illumination period must be worn Protective Manual Book Infant Phototherapy BL-10 eyewear to prevent patients from developing symptoms such as photo- induced keratitis or retinal heat damage.  During the light period, diapers or other similar items must be used to cover the patient's genitals to prevent damage to the patient's genital  During the light period, the water balance in the patient's body may be disrupted, and the nursing staff should replenish the patient's water in  During light, photoisomers of bilirubin may cause toxic effects. For example, patients may experience diarrhea, kernicterus deficiency. With symptoms such as hemolysis and anemia, nursing staff should strengthen monitoring.  The bilirubin value of the patient should be measured regularly.  To avoid dizziness, nausea, blurred vision and other discomforts, nursing staff should not stay in the light-irradiated area for too long ",

Before performing the cleaning procedure, the connection between the equipment and the power supply must be cut off, and the power switch of the equipment must be turned off. General formula Maximum concentration Sodium hypochlorite (bleached) 0.5% aqueous solution Manual Book Infant Phototherapy BL-10 Glutaraldehyde 2% hydrogen peroxide 6% Iodine solution 0.27% a. If you use cleaning/disinfecting solvents with chemical components not listed in the above table (such as ethanol, acetone, etc.), or the concentration of the chemical components exceeds the value listed in the above table, it may damage the equipment. b. Do not immerse the parts in cleaning solvents. Be sure to wipe off all cleaning solvents on the parts. Following these two recommendations can greatly extend the life of the components. c. Any parts cleaned with iodine solvent will produce yellow stains. d. Do not let too much cleaning solvent leak to the position between the plastic parts that is not easy to wipe with a cloth. e. The translucent board cannot be polished or cleaned with high-alkali detergent, benzene, gasoline, acetone, carbon tetrachloride, butyl cellosolve, only a soft cleaning cloth and neutral soap. 5.2 Maintenance 5.2.1 At least once a year, a trained professional with sufficient knowledge and practical experience shall measure the total bilirubin irradiance of the jaundice treatment device, and perform electrical safety and inspection in accordance with the requirements in YY0669 and GB9706.1 Calibration of irradiance. 5.2.2 The lifetime of the light source is 50000 hours. After the light source has exceeded its life span, in order to ensure the effect of phototherapy, it must be completely replaced even if it still works Manual Book Infant Phototherapy BL-10 normally.
