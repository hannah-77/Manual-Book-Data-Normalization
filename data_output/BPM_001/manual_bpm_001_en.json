    "1.3 Penjelasan Simbol": "with the following symbol: At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies. These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and a. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the BPM001 is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the BPM001 should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as re-orienting or relocating the BPM001. b. Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m. Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the BPM001. The BPM001 is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled. The customer or the user of the BPM001 can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment (transmitters) and the BPM001 as recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communications equipment. Separation distance according to frequency of Rated maximum transmitter output power of (m) transmitter 150 KHz to 80 MHz 80 MHz to 800 MHz 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz 0.01 0.12 0.12 0.23 0.1 0.38 0.38 0.73 1 1.2 1.2 2.3 10 3.8 3.8 7.3 100 12 12 23 For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the recommended separation distance d in metres (m) can be estimated using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where P is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) according to the transmitter manufacturer. NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the separation distance for the higher frequency range applies. NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people.
