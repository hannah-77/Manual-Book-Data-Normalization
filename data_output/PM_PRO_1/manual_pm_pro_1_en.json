During the network disconnected status, activating audio alarm paused or audio alarm off function can disable the audio alarm signal of Disconnect Alarm. 4.4 Connecting the Monitor to MFM-CMS The monitor can be connected to the central monitoring system (V2.65 and above). Through the 1. The monitor sends patient information, real-time monitoring or measurement data to the central monitoring system. 2. The real-time monitoring information is displayed on the central monitoring system as the same to the monitor, and the central monitoring system can perform some bilateral control. For example: changing patient information, receiving patient, discharging patient and so For detailed information, please refer to MFM-CMS Central Monitoring System User Manual. And the monitor supports HL7 protocol. 1 Use wired instead of wireless networking when connecting the monitor to central monitoring system in the operating room because the ESU will interfere with a wireless network, which may cause networking failure. 2 Make sure the network connection between the monitor and MFM-CMS is in good condition when the time synchronization function on the monitor is active. (Default setting is ON. Setting path: Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Date/Time Setup > Sync Time). If the setting is on, the monitor will accept time synchronization from MFM-CMS. PM PRO-1 User Manual Network Monitoring 3 The time synchronization function might not be available to all software versions of MFM-CMS. Consult our technical service department or your local distributor for more information. 4 When deploying the network of the monitor and MFM-CMS, it is recommended to isolate the network and the Intranet system of the hospital by using VLAN so as to ensure the network security. Only trusted devices are allowed to join the VLAN 4.5 HL7 Communication The monitor supports HL7 protocol to upload data. Select Menu > User Maintain and input user maintain password > Security. In this menu:  Set HL7 to On/Off. The monitor supports HL7 protocol to upload data. To avoid hacker attacking, setting HL7 to Off is normally recommended. User can also set HL7 IP address of client-side in User Maintain > Network Maintain.  Set HL7 Encryption method to Off or TLS (default).  Set CMS/Gateway Encryption to Off, TLS or AES (default) when user connects the monitor with network server (MFM-CMS or gateway).  Click Import Certificate to install/upgrade the Certificate via USB flash drive. The certificate issued by Certificate Authority (CA) is recommended and self-signed certificate should be avoided. For detailed steps of importing certificates, please refers to service For more information about HL7 communication, refer to HL7 Communication Protocol Service PM PRO-1 User Manual Alarms Chapter 5 Alarms A potential hazard can exist if different alarm presets are used for the same or similar equipment in any single area, e.g. an intensive care unit or cardiac operating room. 5.1 Alarm Category The monitor provides two types of alarm: physiological alarms and technical alarms. Also, the monitor provides prompts. 5.1.1 Physiological Alarms If one or several physiological parameters of the currently monitored patient exceed the predefined alarm limit, the monitor will give an alarm, and this type of alarm is called physiological alarms. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to the Section Physiological Alarm Information. 5.1.2 Technical Alarms If one or several technical status of the device is in abnormal status, the monitor will give an alarm. And this type of alarm is called technical alarms. Technical alarms can’t be disabled. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to Section Technical Alarm Information. 5.1.3 Prompts The monitor can give the character indication of monitoring process or other functions. And this character is called prompts. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to Section 5.2 Alarm Levels In terms of severity, the device’s alarm levels can be classified into three categories: high level alarms, medium level alarms and low level alarms. 1. High level alarms A high level alarm intensively warns the operator of a high priority alarm condition which requires immediate operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in death or irreversible injury of the patient. 2. Medium level alarms A medium level alarm warns the operator of a medium priority alarm condition which requires prompt operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in reversible injury of the patient. 3. Low level alarms A low level alarm reminds the operator of a low priority alarm condition which requires response. And the response time for a low priority alarm condition can be greater than that for PM PRO-1 User Manual Alarms a medium priority alarm condition. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in discomfort or reversible minor injury of the patient. Alarm Sound: The high/medium/low-level alarms are indicated by the system in following different audio ways: Alarm Level Prompt Mode is “DO-DO-DO------DO-DO, DO-DO-DO------DO-DO”, which is triggered once every 10 seconds. The alarm indicator flashes in red, with frequency of 1.4 Hz～2.8 Hz. The alarm message flashes with red background, and the symbol *** is displayed at the alarm area. Mode is “DO-DO-DO”, which is triggered once every 25 seconds. The alarm indicator flashes in yellow, with frequency of 0.4 Hz～0.8 Hz. The alarm message flashes with yellow background, and the symbol ** is displayed at the alarm area. Mode is “DO-”, which is triggered once every 30 seconds. When physiological alarm is triggered, the alarm indicator is constantly Low yellow. While for technical alarm, the alarm indicator is constantly blue. The alarm message flashes with yellow background, and the symbol * is displayed at the alarm area. The sound pressure range for auditory alarm signals is from 45 dB to 85 dB. When different level alarms occur at the same time, alarm sound and alarm indicator prompt the highest level alarm, alarm messages display in turn. The parameter area has two flash methods to prompt alarms: background flash and text flash. User can select one method from Menu > Alarm Setup > Visual Effect: 1) Text Flash: text flashes with frequency of 1 Hz. 2) Background Flash: background flashes with frequency of 1 Hz. Meanwhile, the alarm level icon is displayed in the parameter area. stands for medium or low level alarm and for high level alarm. 1 Do not rely exclusively on the audible alarm system for patient monitoring. Adjustment of alarm volume to a low level or off during patient monitoring may result in patient danger. Remember that the most reliable method of patient monitoring combines close personal surveillance with correct operation of monitoring equipment. 2 Ensure the volume is properly set up. When the sound pressure of audible alarm is below or equivalent to the ambient noise, it may be difficult for the operator to distinguish the audio alarm.

NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which PM Pro-1 is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, PM Pro-1 should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating PM Pro-1. b Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m. c The ISM (industrial, scientific and medical) bands between 0.15 MHz and 80 MHz are 6.765 MHz to 6.795 MHz; 13.553 MHz to 13.567 MHz; 26.957 MHz to 27.283 MHz; and 40.66 MHz to 40.70 MHz.

    "3.2 Overview": "16.1 Overview The monitor provides the sidestream and mainstream methods for CO monitoring. ELITECH EtCO module, Masimo Sidestream CO and Respironics Sidestream CO module are used for sidestream measuring, Masimo Mainstream CO and Respironics Mainstream CO module are used for mainstream measuring. The principle of CO measurement is primarily based on the fact that CO molecule can absorb 4.3 μm infrared ray. Absorption intensity is proportional to CO concentration of patient sample, the CO concentration will compute according to the detecting CO absorption intensity of patient  Sidestream measurement takes a sample of the respiratory gas with a constant sample flow from the patient’s airway and analyzes it with a CO sensor. You can measure sidestream CO using the monitor’s built-in CO measurement. Respiration rate is calculated by measuring the time interval between detected breaths.  Mainstream measurement uses a CO sensor attached to an airway adapter directly inserted into the patient’s breathing system. Identifying CO Modules Sidestream CO modules (From left to right are the Respironics CO module, the ELITECH CO module and Masimo CO module, 1 refers to the gas inlet, 2 refers to the gas outlet): Water trap holder Mainstream CO module: Connector for CO transducer PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring CO 16.2 CO Safety Information 1 Do not use the device in the environment with flammable anesthetic gas. 2 The device should be used by trained and qualified medical personnel authorized by the manufacturer. 3 Nitrous oxide, elevated levels of oxygen, helium, xenon, halogenated hydrocarbons, and barometric pressure can influence the CO measurement. 4 The monitor will be damaged if any pipeline from the CO module’s air tube /the air inlet /the air outlet is plugged by water or other materials. 5 The accuracy of the CO measurement will be affected by the following reasons: the airway was highly obstructed; the leakage of air way connection or quick variation of environment temperature. 6 Follow precautions for electrostatic discharge (ESD) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) to and from other equipment. 7 Do not place the sensor cables or tubing in any manner that may cause entanglement or strangulation. 8 When using mechanical ventilation, gas compensation should be well set. Inappropriate setting may cause incorrect measurement result. 9 Respironics module is not equipped with automatic air pressure compensation, before you start the CO measurement for the first time, you must set the correct altitude. Incorrect altitude settings can cause incorrect CO readings. ELITECH EtCO module is equipped with automatic air pressure compensation, and manual setting is not 10 Leakage in the respiratory system or sampling system may result in a significant low display of the EtCO value. Always keep all components connected firmly and check for leaks according to standard clinical procedures. 11 The EtCO reading is not always closely related to the paCO value, especially in neonatal patients, and patients with pulmonary disease, with pulmonary embolism or inappropriate ventilation. 12 Don’t measure CO while nebulized medications are being delivered. 13 The CO module temporally stops measuring during zeroing. 14 CO Apnea alarm is based on prolonged over-the-threshold EtCO concentration. 15 Do not use the EtCO monitor for diagnostic purpose. 16 CO Apnea alarm should not be used or relied upon while the patient is unattended. 17 Disconnect the water trap from the holder or set Work Mode to Standby when the module is not in use. Setting path: CO Setup > Work Mode > Standby. 1 After the low battery alarm appears, please do not start the CO measurement, or the monitor may turn off for the low capacity of battery. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring CO 2 For disposal of hospital waste such as accumulated fluids, calibration gases, sampled gases, where not otherwise specified, follow local regulations regarding disposal of hospital waste. 3 If the measurement or sensor fails, stop measurement before the qualified service personnel solves the problem. 4 The cumulative use time for the sampling line in a single patient should be less than 23.1 Overview V-NMT module provides the neuromuscular transmission functions of adults and pediatric patients, and it also supports measuring, reviewing, recording, data storage and alarm for neuromuscular transmission. The V- NMT data supports HL7 protocol transmission. 23.2 Safety Information 1 The NMT measurement is not applicable to neonate patients. 2 To preventing parameter setting errors, the user should connect the accessory first, and then insert the plug-in box into the monitor. 3 User of cables or accessories other than those supplied by the manufacturer may result in serious injury. 4 Maintenance on this module may only be performed by the manufacturer or persons explicitly authorized by the manufacturer. 5 Do not use the module in close proximity to equipment that produces strong electromagnetic fields, such as high frequency surgical equipment. The cable leads could act as antennae and dangerous currents could be induced as a result. 6 Do not apply the module to patients with implanted electrical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, without first consulting with an appropriate medical specialist. 7 The device should not be used adjacent to or stacked with other equipment and that if adjacent or stacked use is necessary, the device should be observed to verify normal operation in the configuration in which it will be used. 8 The patient should avoid contact with metallic objects that are grounded, produce an electrical conductive connection with other equipment and/or enable capacitive 9 The cables should be positioned in such a way that they do not contact either the patient or other cables. 10 Simultaneous connection of a patient to high frequency surgical equipment and the module may result in burns and possible damage to the stimulator. 11 For the operation in close proximity (e.g. 1 m) to a shortwave or microwave therapy, the equipment may produce instability in the stimulator output. 12 Application of electrodes near the thorax may increase the risk of cardiac fibrillation. PM PRO-1 User Manual V-NMT Module 1 Remove elements which may adversely affect the connection between the electrodes and the skin, e.g., dirt, hair, oil. 2 Ensure that NMT electrodes are not damaged or dried out. 3 Large current densities associated with failing NMT electrodes may cause superficial 4 The module is designed to be compatible with a standard ECG electrode. 5 Electrodes that have current densities exceeding 2 mA/cm2 may require special attention of the operator. 6 This product must be stored at 0 C – 50 C. 7 This product and all the accessories have been certified latex free. 8 Inspect all parts for any damage or manipulation. Never use any damaged or manipulated part. 9 If an electrically conductive surface of the NMT module or its cables are exposed, such electrically conductive surface may shock a person handling it. Do not use such a device or accessory, please contact the manufacturer for repair. 10 The refractory period delay is set at a default value to prevent the user from repeating stimulation while the nerve synapse is recovering from effects of the previous stimulation. A refractory period of less than 15 seconds in TOF mode is not advisable as measurements might not represent the effect of blocking agents on the neuromuscular junction. 23.3 Turning on / off NMT Measuring Insert the NMT module into the monitor, when the indicator is green, it means the NMT module is connected with the monitor successfully. In Menu > System Setup > Module Switch or select shortcut key ModuleSet > Module Switch, or clicking the blank area of the main screen, user can turn on/off the NMT measurement by ticking or unchecking the NMT. NMT is defaulted to 23.4 Obtaining Max Stimulation Current The user can obtain max stimulation current through two methods: click calibration key on NMT module or Calibration button in NMT Setup. During the NMT calibration process, the NMT parameter area displays prompt information of NMT Calibrating, user can click Stop button again to stop calibration. When the patient type is neonate, the Calibration button is unavailable. PM PRO-1 User Manual V-NMT Module 23.5 NMT Settings Clicking the NMT parameter area, the NMT Setup menu can be displayed. In the NMT Setup menu, user can set:  Stimulation Mode: NMT provides 4 stimulation methods: TOF, PTC, DBS and TWI. The default stimulation method is TOF, which is recommended for most situations. TOF is Train-of-Four stimulation. For TOF stimulation mode, a group of four consecutive super-strong stimulation of 2 Hz (once every 0.5 s) is combined to conduct a group of TOF stimulation measurement. When the block degree deepens, the response of the four stimulations can disappear in the order of 4, 3, 2, and 1. After recovery, the four stimulations responses occurred in the order of 1, 2, 3 and 4. Muscle retardation is assessed by measuring TOFrat (= T4/T1). PTC is post tetanic count stimulation. For PTC mode, in the case of peripheral neuromuscular depth non-depolarizing block, if TOF and TWI are detected to be 0, a 5 s tetanic stimulation at 50 Hz will perform, followed by a pause of 3 s, followed by 20 single current pulses at 1 Hz. The number of detected responses is recorded and displayed as PTC count. The fewer PTC is detected, the deeper is the block. When PTC < 10, TOF disappears. DBS is double burst stimulation. DBS consists of two groups of transient 50 Hz tonic stimulation with an interval of 750 ms. The default pulse of the two groups is DBS3,3. TWI is twitch stimulation. For TWI mode, the deep neuromuscular block can be roughly judged. It can help to determine if the effect is satisfactory after the first dose, and also determine whether additional drugs should be added and the timing of multiple dosing. The stimulation frequency is 2 Hz, and the stimulation stops automatically after 20 times. In TWI mode, NMT parameter area displays Please use visual estimation method for assessment. These three modes: TOF, DBS and PTC are subject to refractory period delays, providing a safety period which prevents the user from repeating stimulation while the nerve synapse is recovering from the effects of the previous stimulation. Default refractory period delays are as follows for these three modes: TOF: 15 seconds; DBS: 1 minutes; PTC: 2 minutes.  Stimulation Times: The adjustable range is 1~100, and step is 1; the default is 1; when stimulation mode is TWI, the stimulation times can not be set. When Stimulation Times is 1, the stimulation is manual. In TOF mode, the monitor responds the new manual stimulation after 15 s; in DBS mode, the monitor responds the new manual stimulation after 1 minutes, in PTC mode, the monitor responds the new manual stimulation after 2 minutes. Within these time period, the prompt information of NMT in Refractory Time will display in the parameter area, and a box with prompt of NMT in Refractory Time also display when Start button is pressed.  Stimulation Interval: The interval in different stimulation mode did not affect each other. In TOF mode, the interval can be set as 16 s, 20 s, 30s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, default is 30 s; in DBS mode, the interval can be set as 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, default is 1 min; In PTC mode, the interval can be set as 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, default is 2 min; in TWI mode, the interval can not be set. The default interval is 2 min.  Facial Mode: When neuromuscular monitoring is carried on patient's face, user can turn on PM PRO-1 User Manual V-NMT Module facial mode. The default setting is Off. When the facial mode is turned on, the stimulation times is 8 during calibration, up to a maximum current of 40 mA. When the facial mode is turned Off, the stimulation times is 16 during calibration, up to a maximum current of 80  Stimulation Current: The adjustable range is 0 mA ~80 mA, step is 1 mA, and the default current is 50 mA. The max stimulation current can be obtained by clicking Calibration button in the module or NMT Setup menu.  Start: User can click the Start button to stimulate, and the button turns to Stop during stimulation process, user can click Stop button to stop the stimulation. During the stimulation, the NMT parameter area displays prompt information of NMT Stimulating. When the patient type is neonate, the Start button is unavailable.  Stimulation Prompt Volume: When the stimulation ends, the monitor prompts “Du-Du” sounds to remind users. The adjustable range is 0~5, and default volume is 3. 23.6 NMT Display When NMT measurement finishes, NMT parameter area displays information including:  The previous stimulation time, with the format of “@hour: minute: second”, for example: @19:01:00;  Stimulation interval countdown, with the format of “minute: second”, for example: 01:59;  Stimulation interval, unit is min, for example: 2 min; when stimulation time is 1, the stimulation interval and interval countdown won’t be displayed;  Stimulation result, including the stimulation response bar chart and parameter display.

Before using the function of nurse call, check if it is functioning normally. 31.2 Storing Data in the Storage Device 31.2.1 Data Stored in the Storage Device Refer to Section Data Management for more information about single patient data volume. You can choose to Keep Storing or Stop Storing by selecting Menu > Common Function > Data Store > if one patient data full. When the single patient data reach the maximum, the monitor will keep storing or stop storing as selected. If you choose Keep Storing, as soon as the single patient data is full, the earliest data will be replaced by the latest one. When the remaining storage space is less than 15 M, the earliest patient data in the storage space will be deleted in order to store the latest data. If you choose Stop Storing, the monitor will stop data storing and the latest data cannot be stored when the single patient data reach the maximum. For instance, if all the patient data (such as the trend graph, trend table, NIBP measurements, arrhythmia event, alarm event and 12-lead analysis) except waveforms reach the maximum, the monitor will stop storing, while only the waveforms keep storing until they are full. When the remaining storage space is less than 10 M, the monitor will stop storing new data, prompting insufficient storage space. The default setting of if one patient data full is Stop Storing. The monitor can detect the storage space threshold. Select Menu > Common Function > Data Store and set Threshold Detection to On. When the removable device is newly inserted and selected as storage device, and its remaining storage space is less than 300 M, the monitor will not store data, prompting The space in U disk is less than 300 M. Please clean it up. The user needs to clean up the space manually till the remaining space is more than 300 M, thus the monitor will keep storing data. When this removable device is read-only and its space is insufficient, the monitor only provides alarm of Read-only storage device. 1 The storage time varies according to the patient's parameter data volume.

Select Current Patient to use the current configuration; Select New Patient to admit new patient. If the user does not make a selection within 1 minutes, Current Patient is selected by 7.2 Admitting a Patient The monitor displays physiological data and stores it in the trends as soon as a patient is connected. This allows you to monitor a patient who is not yet admitted. It is however important to admit patients properly so that you can identify your patient on recordings, reports, and networked devices. During admission you enter data that the monitor needs for safe and accurate operation. For example, the patient category setting determines the algorithm the monitor uses to process and calculate some measurements, the safety limits that are applied for some measurements, and the alarm limit ranges. To admit a patient, please: 1. Select Menu > Patient Setup > New Patient, then a message is displayed to ask the user to confirm to update patient. 2. Click on No to cancel this operation; click on Yes, the Patient Info window is displayed. 3.

Chinese, English, Russian, numbers and special characters can be input.  Doctor: Enter the attending doctor for the patient.  Gender: Male, Female and N/A.  Type: Choose the patient type, Adult, Pediat, or Neonat.  BloodType: N/A, A, B, AB and O.  Pace: Choose On or Off (You must select On if your patient has a pacemaker).  Date of Birth: Enter the patient’s date of birth.  Date of Admission: Enter the patient’s date of admission.  Height: Enter the patient’s height, with unit: cm or inch.  Weight: Enter the patient’s weight, with unit: kg or lb. 1 For Bed No., user can select English, Chinese, Russian through switching keyboard language, and select special characters through . 2 Creating new patient and updating patient will clear the history data in the monitor associated with the patient. 7.2.1 Patient Category and Paced Status The patient category setting determines the algorithm which the monitor uses to process and calculate some measurements, the safety limits that are applied for some measurements, and the alarm limit ranges. The paced setting determines whether the monitor shows pacemaker pulses or not. When Pace is set to Off, pace pulses are filtered and therefore do not show in the ECG wave. 1 Changing the patient category may change the arrhythmia and NIBP alarm limits. Always check alarm limits to make sure that they are appropriate for your patient. 2 For paced patients, you must set Paced to On. If it is incorrectly set to Off, the monitor could mistake a pace pulse for a QRS and fail to give an alarm during 7.3 Quick Admit If you do not have the time or information to fully admit a patient, you can use Quick Admit to quickly admit a patient and complete the rest of the patient information later.

PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG Chapter 9 Monitoring ECG 9.1 Overview The electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart and displays it on the monitor as a waveform and a numeric. This chapter also tells you about arrhythmia monitoring and ST monitoring. ECG connector 9.2 ECG Safety Information 1 Only use the ECG leads supplied by the manufacturer when using the monitor for ECG monitoring. 2 When connecting the cables and electrodes, make sure no conductive part is in contact with the ground. Verify that all ECG electrodes, including neutral electrodes, are securely attached to the patient but not the conductive part or ground. 3 Place the electrode carefully and ensure a good contact. Check every day whether there is skin irritation resulted from the ECG electrodes. If yes, replace electrodes every 24 hours or change their sites. 4 Store the electrodes in room temperature. Open the electrode package immediately prior to use. Never mix electrode types or brands. This may lead to problem due to impedance difference. When applying the electrodes, avoid bones close to skin, obvious layers of fat and major muscles. Muscle movement can result in electrical interference. Applying electrodes on major muscles, for example on muscles of thorax, may lead to erroneous arrhythmia alarm due to excessive muscle movement. 5 Check if the lead connection is correct before monitoring. If you unplug the ECG cable from the socket, the screen will display the error message “ECG LEAD OFF” and the audible alarm is activated. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 6 If the ECG signal exceeds the measuring range, the monitor will indicates it by a message “ECG Signal Exceeded”. 7 In order to avoid being burnt, please keep the electrodes far away from the radio knife while using electrosurgical equipment. 8 When using Electrosurgery (ES) equipment, do not place an electrode near the grounding plate of the Electrosurgery device, otherwise there will be a great deal of interference with the ECG signal. 9 The electrodes should be made of the same metal materials. 10 ECG cables can be damaged when connected to a patient during defibrillation or using other high frequency equipment. Check cables for functionality before using them again. It is recommended to use defibrillator-proof ECG lead to avoid burn. 11 According to AAMI specifications the peak of the synchronized defibrillator discharge should be delivered within 60 ms of the peak of the R wave. The synchronization pulse output on the patient monitors is delayed by a maximum of 35 ms from the R wave peak. Your biomedical engineer should verify that your ECG/Defibrillator combination does not exceed the recommended maximum delay of 60 ms. 12 Before outputting signals with defibrillator synchronization or ECG, check if the output is functioning normally. 13 ECG accessories are not suitable for DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION (Refer to IEC60601-1 for more information about the definition of DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION). 14 Line isolation monitor transients may resemble actual cardiac waveforms and thus inhibit heart rate alarms. When the electrode or lead is loose or fallen, the monitor is easily affected by the transient response of certain types of insulation monitors. The transient monitor signal produced by poor insulation of the line may be very similar to the actual heart waveform, which will prevent the monitor from prompting a heart rate alarm. In order to avoid this, user should check lead wires for damage and ensure good skin contact prior to and during use. Always use fresh electrodes and follow proper skin preparation techniques. 15 The monitor can only be used on one patient at a time. Monitoring more than one patient simultaneously may result in hazards to the patient. 16 Pacemaker Failure: During a complete cardiac block or when pacemaker is unable to pacing/capture, high P-wave (greater than 1/5 of the average height of the R-wave) may be incorrectly counted by the monitor, which leads to a missing asystole. 1 Interference from a non-grounded instrument near the patient and ESU interference can cause inaccuracy of the waveform. 2 IEC/EN60601-1-2 (protection against radiation is 3 v/m) specifies that the electrical PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG field density exceeding 3 v/m may cause measurement error in various frequencies. It is accordingly suggested that do not use equipment generating electrical radiation near ECG/RESP monitoring devices. 3 If the pacemaker signals are beyond the claimed range, the heart rate may be calculated incorrectly. 4 In the default settings of the monitor, the ECG waveforms are the first two waveforms from top in the waveform area. 5 For measurements in or near the heart we recommend connecting the monitor to the potential equalization system. 6 For protecting environment, the used electrodes must be recycled or disposed of 9.3 ECG Display The figure below is for reference only. The symbol ① indicates lead name of display waveform: there are several options, such as I, II, III, aVR, aVF, aVL, V (for 5 Electrodes). If you want to change the lead, please refer to Section Selecting Calculation Lead. The symbol ② indicates Filter setting, there are six options: Monitor, Surgery, Diagnosis, Enhanced, Diagnosis 1, and Customized. If you want to change it, please refer to Section Changing the ECG Filter Setting. The symbol ③ indicates waveform gain: there are several options, such as X0.125, X0.25, X0.5, X1, X2, X4 and AUTO. If you want to change it, please refer to Section Changing the Size of the 9.3.1 Changing the Size of the ECG Wave If any of the displayed ECG waveform is too small or clipped, you can change the size of it on the screen. First select ECG Waveform Setup > ECG Gain, then select an appropriate factor from the pop-up box to adjust the ECG waveform. X0.125: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 1.25 mm; PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG X0.25: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 2.5 mm; X0.5: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 5 mm; X1: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 10 mm; X2: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 20 mm; X4: make size of ECG signal waveform of 1mV become 40 mm; AUTO: let the monitor choose the optimal adjustment factor for all the ECG waves. The effect of ECG wave gain is subject to the size of the wave area. Whichever wave gain is chosen, the ECG wave has to be displayed within the wave area, the exceeded part is clipped. 9.3.2 Changing the ECG Filter Settings The ECG filter setting defines how ECG waves are smoothed. An abbreviation indicating the filter type is shown underneath the lead label on the monitor display. Filter settings do not affect ST measurement. To change the filter setting, in the ECG Setup menu, select Filter and then select the appropriate – Monitor: Use this mode under normal measurement conditions. – Surgery: The filter reduces interference to the signal. It should be used if the signal is distorted by high frequency or low frequency interference. High frequency interference usually results in large amplitude spikes making the ECG signal look irregular. Low frequency interference usually leads to a wandering or rough baseline. In the operating room, the Filter reduces artifacts and interference from electro-surgical units. Under normal measurement conditions, selecting Surgery may suppress the QRS complexes too much and thus interfere with the clinical evaluation of the ECG displayed on the monitor. – Diagnosis: Use when undistorted signal is required and its own characteristics can be maintained. The waveform filtered by the bandwidth of 0.05 Hz~150 Hz is displayed so that the actual changes such as R-wave notching or discrete elevation or depression of the ST segments are visible. – Enhanced: It should be used if the signal is distorted by strong interference from high frequency or low frequency. If there is still obviously interference in the signals when select surgery filter mode, it is recommended to choose the enhanced mode. In this mode, QRS wave rhythm information is emphasized, its shape information cannot be considered as diagnostic criteria. Under normal measurement conditions, the selection of this mode may inhibit QRS wave group and interfere ECG analysis. – Diagnosis 1: To meet the filtering requirements of ST analysis, it is used when ST analysis is turned on or when ST analysis results are concerned. – Customized: User can set High-pass Filter and Low-pass Filter as needed. Cutoff frequency of High-pass can be selected as: 0.01 Hz, 0.05 Hz, 0.15 Hz, 0.25 Hz, 0.32 Hz, 0.5 Hz and 0.67 PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG Hz. Cutoff frequency of Low-pass Filter can be selected as: 25 Hz, 35 Hz, 45 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz. After High-pass filter and Low-pass Filter are set, the bandwidth range of high – pass bandwidth to low - pass bandwidth can be formed. 9.4 Selecting Calculation Lead To set the calculation lead, select ECG Setup > Calc. Lead, or on the Normal display interface, click on the calculation lead waveform area, select Calc. Lead from the popup interface to make the appropriate setting. For 3 Electrodes, II, I, and III are selectable; For 5 Electrodes, II, I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V are selectable; For 6 Electrodes, II, I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF and leads corresponding to Va and Vb are selectable; For 10 Electrodes, II, I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are selectable. Normal QRS complex should be:  The normal QRS should be either completely above or below the baseline and it should not be biphasic. For paced patients, the QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of pace pulses.  The QRS should be tall and narrow.  The P-waves and the T-waves should be less than 0.2 mV. Make sure you have selected the best lead with the best waveform amplitude and highest signal-to-noise ratio. Choosing the best lead is important for heart beat test, heart beat classification and ventricular fibrillation detection. 9.5 Monitoring Procedure 9.5.1 Preparation The skin is a poor conductor of electricity; therefore preparation of the patient's skin is important to facilitate good electrode contact to skin.  Select sites with intact skin, without impairment of any kind.  Shave hair from sites, if necessary.  Wash sites thoroughly with soap and water. (Never use ether or pure alcohol, because this increases skin impedance).  Rub the skin briskly to increase capillary blood flow in the tissues and remove skin scurf and 9.5.2 Connecting ECG Cables 1. Attach clip or snap to electrodes prior to placement. 2. Put the electrodes on the patient. Before attaching, apply some conductive jelly on the electrodes if the electrodes are not electrolyte self-supplied. 3. Connect the electrode lead to the patient's cable. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 4. Plug the patient cable into the ECG connector on XM module. To protect the monitor from damage during defibrillation, for accurate ECG information and to protect against noise and other interference, use only ECG electrodes and cables specified by the manufacturer. 9.5.3 Selecting Electrode Type To change the electrode type, please: 1. Select the ECG parameter area, open the ECG Setup menu; 2.

PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 10 Electrodes Placement Recommended ECG Electrode Placement for Surgical Patients When using Electrosurgery (ES) equipment, leads should be placed in a position in equal distance from Electrosurgery electrotome and the ES grounding plate to avoid cautery. Electrosurgery equipment wire and ECG cable must not be tangled up. Monitoring ECG leads are mainly used for monitoring the patient’s vital signs. When using the patient monitor with other electrosurgery equipment, it is advised to use the counteracting defibrillation ECG lead. The placement of the ECG leads will depend on the type of surgery that is being performed. For example, in an open chest surgery the electrodes may be placed laterally on the chest or on the back. In the operating room, artifacts may affect the ECG waveform due to the use of ES (Electrosurgery) equipment. To help reduce this you can place the electrodes on the right and left shoulders, the right and left sides near the abdomen, and the chest lead on the left side at mid- chest. Avoid placing the electrodes on the upper arms. Otherwise the ECG waveform will be too ECG cables can be damaged when connected to a patient during defibrillation or using other high frequency equipment. Check cables for functionality before using them again. It is recommended to use defibrillator-proof ECG lead to avoid burn. 1 If an ECG waveform is not accurate, while the electrodes are tightly attached, try to change the leads displayed on the screen. 2 Interference from a non-grounded instrument near the patient and ESU interference PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG can cause inaccuracy of the waveform. 9.6 ECG Menu Setup 9.6.1 Setting Alarm Source To change the alarm source, please select ECG Setup > Alarm Source, then a pop-up box is displayed: HR: the monitor considers the HR as HR/PR alarm source; PR: the monitor considers the PR as HR/PR alarm source; AUTO: If the Alarm Source is set to AUTO, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the alarm source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on and at least one ECG lead can be measured without a technical condition. The monitor will automatically switch to PR as the alarm source if: –a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and –a PR source is switched on and available. The monitor then uses the pulse rate from the measurement currently active as system pulse. While PR is the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are switched off. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as alarm source. 9.6.2 Setting Beat Source To change the beat source, select either ECG Setup > Beat Source or PR Setup > Beat Source. Select from the following options: HR: HR is HR/PR beat source; PR: PR is HR/PR beat source; AUTO: If the Beat Source is set to AUTO, the monitor will use HR as the beat source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on, and at least one ECG lead can be measured. The monitor will automatically switch to PR as the beat source if:  a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and  a PR source is switched on and available. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as beat source and the monitor gives a \"Di\" tone with a blinking heart displaying in the HR parameter box when one heartbeat is detected. While a pulse is detected, the monitor gives a \"Da\" tone. 9.6.3 Smart Lead Off When Smart LeadOff is set to On, if the current selected calculation lead can not detect ECG signal, the monitor automatically switches the corresponding lead as calculation lead, and switches the waveform display of calculation lead at the same time. When ECG electrode is re- connected, and the original calculation lead recover its signals, the monitor automatically PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG switch to the original calculation lead. To change the smart lead off setting, select ECG Setup > Smart LeadOff, and select the desired 9.6.4 ECG Screen Layout It varies with Electrode Type. When Electrode Type is set to 3 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal, and it can display one ECG waveform on the main screen. When Electrode Type is set to 5 Electrodes or 6 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal, Full-Scr and Half-Scr. Select Normal to display two ECG waveforms on the main screen; In 5 electrodes, select Full-Scr to display seven ECG waveforms which occupy the area of seven waveforms on the main screen; In 6 electrodes, select Full-Scr to display eight ECG waveforms which occupy the area of eight waveforms on the main screen; Select Half-Scr to display seven ECG waveforms on the screen, occupying the area of four waveforms. When Electrode Type is set to 10 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal and 12 Leads. Select Normal to display two ECG waveforms on the main screen; select 12 Leads to display 13 ECG waveforms. When Electrode Type is set to AUTO, the monitor can automatically identify the electrode type according to the actual connection condition of the electrodes, and provide as much lead data as possible when the condition of the lead signal is satisfied. 1 If 3 Electrodes is selected in the ECG Setup menu, only Normal can be selected for Screen Layout in the sub-menu. 2 In 10 Electrodes display interface, the filter can only be set to Diagnosis. 3 If 6 Electrodes is selected in the ECG Setup menu, Va and Vb can be respectively set to either Lead V1 ~ V6, but cannot be set to the same lead, Va is Lead V2 by default, Vb is Lead V5 by default. 4 If AUTO is selected in the ECG Setup menu, when the electrodes connected to patient is reduced from 10 electrodes to 3/5/6 electrodes, user can click Update Lead Setup button to enable the monitor to perform lead off alarm according to actual electrodes. 5 If AUTO is selected in the ECG Setup menu, Va and Vb cannot be set when the monitor recognizes the 10 electrodes system automatically. Va is fixed as V1 and Vb is fixed as V2. 9.6.5 Setting Pace Status It is important to set the paced status correctly when you start monitoring ECG. To change the paced status in the ECG Setup menu, select Pace to toggle between On or Off. When Pace is set - Pace Pulse Rejection is switched on. This means that pacemaker pulses are not counted as PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG extra QRS complexes. - Paced symbol is displayed as | on the main screen. At this time, the artifact is displayed on the screen instead of the actual pacemaker crest. All pacemaker crests are the same, so do not give a diagnostic explanation about the size and shape of the pacemaker crest. When monitoring a patient with a pacemaker, set Pace to On. If monitoring a patient without a pacemaker, set Pace to Off. 1 Some pace pulses can be difficult to reject. When this happens, the pulses are counted as a QRS complex, and could result in an incorrect HR and failure to detect cardiac arrest or some arrhythmias. Be sure to check the paced symbol on the display screen has correctly detected the pacing pulse. Keep pacemaker patients under close observation. 2 For patients with pacemakers, the pace must be switched ON. Otherwise, the pacing impulse may be counted as regular QRS complexes, which could prevent an asystole event from being detected. When changing settings and admitting patients, please make sure the pace mode is always correct. 3 External pacing electrodes: When using pacemakers with external pacing electrodes on the patient, the quality of arrhythmia is severely degraded due to the high energy level in the pacemaker pulse. This can cause arrhythmia algorithms can not detect the pacemaker without capturing or asystole. 9.6.6 ECG Calibration This item is used to calibrate ECG waveform. When you select this item from ECG Setup menu again, the ECG waveform calibration ends. The patients can’t be monitored during ECG calibration. 9.6.7 ECG Waveform Settings To change the speed, select ECG Waveform Setup > Sweep (mm/s), then select an appropriate setting from the pop-up list. The bigger the value is, the wider the waveform is. Select ECG Waveform Setup > Cascade: Turn on or off ECG cascade. Cascade means the ECG waveforms displayed on the screen all occupy the area of two waveforms. This function is valid only when Screen Layout is set to Normal. 9.7 12-Lead ECG Monitoring In 12-lead display mode, 12 ECG waveforms and one rhythm lead waveform will be shown at the PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG waveform area on the screen. The rhythm lead is for ECG calculation before entering 12-lead display mode. Also, in this mode, the filter mode is set to Diagnosis and can not be changed. 1 The 12-lead analysis results are for reference only and the analysis significance must be determined by the physician. 2 If the ECG signal is too weak, the 12-lead analysis results might be affected. 3 SEMIP algorithm is a 12-lead ECG automatic measurement and analysis algorithm. Regarding to the standards' instructions for ECG measurement and analysis of the 4 For 12-lead analysis, the gain selection contains: 1.25 mm/mV (×0.125), 2.5 mm/mV (×0.25), 5 mm/mV (×0.5), 10 mm/mV (×1), AUTO gain. 5 As the 12-lead analysis system of the monitor is not exactly identical to the 12 conventional ECG leads obtained from an electrocardiograph, its measurement is for reference only and should not be used for diagnostic interpretations. 9.7.1 Activating 12-Lead ECG Monitoring Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups > Activate 6/10 Electrodes in order to get the SN number which is supposed to be supplied to the manufacturer for a corresponding password. Enter the password on the above-mentioned interface and restart the monitor, and the 6/10 Electrodes ECG monitoring function will be activated. If the 6/10 Electrodes ECG monitoring fails to be activated, users can reenter the password and try to activate this function again. 9.7.2 Analysis Function If your monitor is configured with the 12-lead ECG monitoring function, the monitor can perform automatic analysis function. To perform 12-lead analysis: 1. In the ECG Setup menu, set Electrode Type to 10 Electrodes and set Screen Layout to 12 2. Select the shortcut key on the screen directly. 3. The analysis results will be provided in the Analysis Review window after approximately 10 The measurement function provides the automatic measurement of the common parameters, such as heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT/QTC interval, P/QRS/T axis, RV5/SV1 amplitude and RV5+SV1 amplitude. The interpretation function provides the automatic analysis of hundreds of abnormal cases, such as arrhythmia, AV block, IVCD (Intraventricular Conduction Block), myocardial infarction, ventricular hypertrophy and atrial enlargement, ST-T abnormality and electrical axis deviation. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.7.3 Waveform Durations and Isoelectric Segments Between the global onset and offset of the QRS-complex, signal parts with a duration of more than 6 ms and amplitude not exceeding 20 μV should be defined as isoelectric segments. Because the duration of the Q-, R- or S-wave of 12 leads is respectively detected by the ECG algorithm, isoelectric parts (I-waves) after global QRS-onset or before global QRS-offset (K- wave) are excluded in the measurement duration of the respective adjacent waveform. QRS Duration = Rd+Sd+R’d Q Duration R Duration R Duration S Duration 9.8 ST Segment Monitoring The monitor performs ST segment analysis on normal and atrially paced beats and calculates ST segment elevations and depressions. This information can be displayed in the form of ST numerics and ST templates on the monitor. ST segment monitoring function is shut off by default. You can switch it to On when necessary. When using the ST analysis function, the ST analysis results will be displayed on the right of the main screen. 1 ST-segment analysis is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for use with neonatal and pediatric patients. For this reason, the recommended and default setting for ST analysis in neonatal and pediatric modes is 2 In ST analysis, the obtained ST value and ST template are all unaffected by the selected filter mode. ST algorithm itself uses a dedicated linear filter to ensure the signal is not distorted, and to better ensure the consistent and accurate measurement value and ST template can be obtained in different filter modes. If the doctor wants to observe the waveform to evaluate ST segment result, it is recommended to use the ST template for observation, as it is not affected by the filter mode. If the real-time waveform displayed on the interface is used to evaluate ST PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG segment result, it is recommended to select Diagnosis mode. 3 Reliable ST monitoring may be influenced in following situations:  You are unable to get a lead with low noise.  If there is arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation/flutter, the ECG baseline may be irregular.  The patient is continually performing ventricular paced.  The dominant template can not be obtained for a long time.  The patient has left bundle branch block. When any of above situations happens, ST monitoring should be switched off. 4 The ST algorithm has been tested for accuracy of the ST segment data. The significance of the ST segment changes need to be determined by a clinician. 5 If you use ST analysis, you must adjust the ST measurement point when you start the monitor. If the patient's heart rate or ECG waveform changes significantly, this will affect the size of the QT interval, so the ST point must be placed. If the equipotential or ST points are not set correctly, the ST fragments of the artifacts may be depressed or raised. Always ensure that the ST measurement point is suitable for your patient. 6 ST values may be affected by such factors as some drugs or metabolic and conduction disturbances. 7 ST is calculated with a fixed delay from the R position. Changes in heart rate or the width of QRS may affect ST. 8 If the algorithm triggers self-learning (either manually or automatically), the calculation of ST segment will be reinitialized 9.8.1 Setting ST Analysis To change ST analysis, please select ECG Setup > ST Analysis, then select On or Off from the pop-up list. 9.8.2 ST Display Your monitor screen may be configured to look slightly different from the illustrations. 9.8.3 About ST Measurement Points The ST value for each beat complex is the vertical difference between the ISO point and the ST PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG point, as shown in the diagram below. The isoelectric (ISO) point provides the baseline, and the ST point is at the midpoint of the ST segment. The J point is where the QRS complex changes its slope; as it is a fixed distance away from the ST point, it can be useful to help you position the ST point correctly. The ST and ISO measurement points need to be adjusted when you start monitoring, and if the patient's heart rate or ECG morphology changes significantly. Always ensure that ST measurement points are appropriate for your patient. Abnormal QRS complex is not considered in ST segment analysis. 9.8.4 Adjusting ST and ISO Measurement Points Depending on your monitor’s configuration, the ST point can be positioned, too. These two points can be adjusted by turning the knob. When adjusting ST measurement point, the system will show the ST Measurement Point Window. The system displays the QRS complex template in the window. It is adjustable for the highlight bar in the window. You may select ISO or ST, switch the knob left or right to move the cursor line. When the cursor is at the required position, you may select the base point or the measurement point. 9.8.5 ST Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > ST Analysis > ST Alarm Setup to change the ST Alarm Mode: Real Time: The user can set the alarm switch, alarm level, alarm limit and alarm record separately for each ST or all ST. Differential: The monitor triggers the alarm according to the change of ST. The user does not need to set alarm for each ST separately, but only need to set alarm switch, alarm level and alarm difference value (-0.1~0.1) for all ST. When ST Alarm Mode is differential, the user needs to select Delay to set the ST alarm delay time. 3 seconds and 5 seconds are optional, and the default is 3 seconds. Besides, the Difference and baseline value shall be set, the difference range is 0.01 mv ~0.1 mv, and the baseline range is -1.90 mv ~1.90 mv. 9.8.6 ST View The ST View displays a complete QRS segment for each ST lead. The color of current ST segment and ST value are consistent with the color of HR. The color of baseline and ST value are yellow. To enter ST view, please select ST View in ST Analysis. In the ST View interface, the user can save ST baseline through clicking Save as Base when ST PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG values gets stable. If no ST baseline is saved, the monitor automatically saves the baseline when the first valid and complete ST waveform appears. In the ST View interface, the user can display the current waveform, baseline waveform, or the both by selecting Real, Baseline or Real+Base. The user can also hide or display ST points by selecting Hide Points or Show Points. Besides, the user can record and print the ST view. In the ST View interface, the user can save ST segment through clicking Save ST SEG. Up to 20 groups of ST segments can be saved. When the 21st ST segment is saved, the earliest ST segment will be deleted. The ST baseline and ST segment will be cleared in following situations: 1) Turning off the monitor; 2) Changing the electrode type; 3) Changing the calculation lead in 3 electrodes; 4) Entering or exiting Demo mode; 5) Changing the patient type; 6) Admitting new patients; In order to view the ST value situation of each lead more intuitively, the user can enter into the ST Histogram. The horizontal axis shows the lead name while the vertical axis shows the ST value. And the bar graph is used to display the ST value result. The ST histogram refreshes with ST View synchronizely. 9.9 Arrhythmia Monitoring 9.9.1 Arrhythmia Analysis The arrhythmia algorithm is used to monitor ECG of adult patients in clinics, and detect the changes of heart rate and ventricular rhythm, and also save arrhythmia events and generate alarm information. Arrhythmia algorithm can monitor paced and non-paced patients. Qualified personnel can use arrhythmia analysis to evaluate patient’s condition (such as heart rate, PVCs frequency, rhythm and ectopic beat) and decide the treatment. Besides detecting change of ECG, arrhythmia algorithm can also monitor patients and give proper alarm for arrhythmia. The monitor can support 2 configurations for ARR analysis, Basic ARR or Advanced ARR (also called Basic or Advanced). The default is Advanced ARR. For configuration selection, please contact service personnel of the manufacturer. 1 Advanced ARR analysis is not available in U.S.A. 2 When PM PRO-2 (as sub-monitor) is connected to PM PRO-1 patient monitor, if PM PRO-2 supports Advanced ARR, it will synchronize with PM PRO-1 patient monitor; if not, Basic ARR will be adopted. 3 When XM module or PM PRO-2 has been inserted into PM PRO-1 patient monitor, user unplugs the inserted one from the monitor and reinserts another one, if the ARR analyses of PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG newly inserted one is inconsistent with that of the previous one, the monitor will pop up a prompt to notify user that ARR analysis is switched to Basic or Advanced. 4 The measured PVCs and Pauses/min will be displayed in main interface. Pauses/min is only applicable to Advanced ARR. 5 Advanced ARR is intended to be used with MFM-CMS 2.65 or above version. ARR Alarms Occurring Condition Applicable to both Basic ARR and Advanced ARR No QRS is detected for 4 consecutive seconds 4 consecutive seconds' fibrillation wave occurs; Or 5 consecutive ventricular V-Fib/V-Tach beats, and ventricular HR ≥100 bpm. 3 ≤ the number of consecutive PVCs < 5 2 consecutive PVCs A dominant rhythm of N, V, N, V (N = supraventricular beat, V = ventricular beat) was detected. A dominant rhythm of N, N, V, N, N, V A type of single PVC under the condition that HR < 100, R-R interval is less than 1/3 the average interval, followed by a compensating pause of 1.25X the average R-R interval (the next R wave advances onto the previous T wave). Single PVC detected in normal heartbeats, and the number of consecutive single PVC ≥ 4 within 30 s. Adult: RR interval for 5 consecutive QRS complex ≤ 0.5 s. Pediatric/neonatal: RR interval for 5 consecutive QRS complex ≤ 0.375 s. Adult: RR interval for 5 consecutive QRS complex ≥ 1.5 s. Pediatric/neonatal: RR interval for 5 consecutive QRS complex ≥ 1 s. If HR < 120 bpm, no beats are detected for 1.75 times average RR interval; or if HR ≥ 120 bpm, no beats are detected for one second; or no valid QRS Missed Beat wave is detected within 3 s or longer. If HR < 120 bpm, no beats are detected for 1.75 times average RR interval; or if HR ≥ 120 bpm, no beats are detected for one second; Irr Rhythm Consistently irregular heart rhythm No QRS complex detected in 300 ms after a pace pulse. No pace pulse detected in 1.75 times RR interval after a QRS complex. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG ARR Alarms Occurring Condition 5 consecutive ventricular beats, and ventricular HR < 40 bpm. Vent Brady 5 consecutive ventricular beats, and ventricular HR < 20 bpm. 5 consecutive ventricular beats, and 40 bpm ≤ ventricular HR < 100 bpm. Vent Rhythm 5 consecutive ventricular beats, and 20 bpm ≤ ventricular HR < 40 bpm. The measurement value of PVCs is greater than high alarm limit that has Applicable to Advanced ARR: The duration of ventricular tachycardia rhythm ≥ the threshold value that has Sustain VT ExtremeTachy HR ≥ Extreme Tachycardia threshold value that has been set. ExtremeBrady HR ≤ Extreme Bradycardia threshold value that has been set. V-Tach 5 consecutive ventricular beats and ventricular HR ≥ 100 bpm. Meet tachycardia conditions, and QRS wave width ≥ 160 ms. Non-Sustain 3 ≤ The number of consecutive ventricular beats < 5, and ventricular HR ≥ VT 100 bpm. Atrial fibrillation alarm should meet below two conditions for 1 minute: The RR interval of normal beats must be irregular, and it can be seen that the obvious f or P waves do not exist. 5 consecutive ventricular beats, and 40 bpm ≤ ventricular HR < 100 bpm. No QRS is detected within the heartbeat pause threshold value that has been Pauses/min The measurement value of Pause/min is greater than high alarm limit that has High been set. The delayed ventricular beats detected in normal heartbeats occur more than or equal to 2 times within 30 s. Different forms of ventricular premature beats are detected in 15 beats. The single ventricular premature beat between 2 sinus beats with normal interval occurs more than or equal to 3 times within 30 s. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG ARR Alarms Occurring Condition The dominant rhythm of N, A, N, A, N, A, and the rhythm number exceeds the number of threshold value that has been set (N = supraventricular beat, A = atrial beat). PAC The dominant rhythm of N, N, A, N, N, A, N, N, A, and the rhythm number Trigeminy exceeds the number of threshold value that has been set. The signal amplitudes of I, II and III leads shall not exceed alarm threshold value that has been set. PS: this alarm is available for 5, 6 or 10 electrodes Voltage(Limb) only, not available for 3 electrodes. NOTE: Arrhythmia monitoring is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for use with neonatal and pediatric patients. For this reason, the recommended setting for arrhythmia monitoring in neonatal and pediatric modes is Off. Selecting an ECG lead for Arrhythmia: In arrhythmia monitoring, it is important to select the appropriate lead. For non-paced patients, the guidelines are: - QRS should be tall and narrow (recommended amplitude > 0.5 mV) - R wave should be above or below the baseline (but not biphasic) - T wave should be smaller than 1/3 of the R wave height - P wave should be smaller than 1/5 of the R wave height. For paced patients, in addition to above guidelines, the pacemaker signal should also: - not wider than normal QRS - The QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of the pacing pulse - large enough to be detected, without repolarization signal According to Standard ISO60601-2-27, the minimum detection level of the QRS complex is set to 0.15 mV, to prevent the detection of P-wave or baseline noise as QRS complexes. Adjusting ECG displayed waveform size (gain adjustment) won’t influence ECG signals which are used for arrhythmia analysis. If the ECG signal is too small, a false asystole alarm may occur. Aberrantly-Conducted Beats: As not recognizing the P waves, the monitoring system is difficult to distinguish between aberrantly-conducted beats and ventricular heartbeat. If the aberrantly-conducted beat is similar to ventricular tachycardia, it may be classified as ventricular. Make sure to select such a lead, the aberrantly-conducted beats have an R wave that is as narrow as possible to minimize the incorrect calls. The ventricular should have a different appearance from “normal heartbeat”. Physicians should be more alert to these patients. Intermittent bundle branch block: bundle branch block or other bundle obstruction phenomenon is a challenge for arrhythmia algorithm. If the QRS wave during the block has a considerable change in morphology compared to the normal QRS of learning, the blocked heartbeat may be misclassified as ventricular tachycardia, resulting in an incorrect chamber alarm. Make sure to select such a lead, which blocks the heartbeat of the R wave as narrow as possible to minimize the wrong classification. Ventricular heartbeat should have a different appearance from “normal PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG heartbeat”. Physicians should be more alert to these patients. 1 Heart rate reading may be affected by cardiac arrhythmias. Do not rely entirely on heart rate alarms when monitoring patients with arrhythmia. Always keep these patients under close surveillance. 2 Since the arrhythmia detection algorithm sensitivity and specificity is less than 100%, sometimes there may be some false arrhythmias detected and also some true arrhythmia events may not be detected. This is especially true when the signal is 3 The ventricular HR mentioned above refers to:  In Basic ARR, when the consecutive PVCs number ≥ 5, the algorithm calculates ventricular HR with the average of 4-8 RR intervals.  In Advanced ARR, when the consecutive PVCs number ≥ 3, the algorithm calculates ventricular HR with the average of 2-8 RR intervals. The methods are different from the HR Averaging Method of the monitor. Therefore, the ventricular HR values calculated by Basic /Advanced algorithm may be different from the HR values calculated by HR Averaging Method. The ventricular HR is for judging arrhythmias and is not exactly equal to the HR displayed on the interface. 4 The ARR analysis results and HR values obtained during ARR analysis and HR calculation are not affected by the selected filter mode. The algorithm itself has independent data-flow processing, which can better ensure the consistent and accurate results in different filter modes. 5 Atrial fibrillation alarm should meet below two conditions for 1 minute:  The RR interval of normal beats must be irregular,  It can be seen that the obvious f or P waves do not exist. 6 Atrial fibrillation analysis is only applicable to adult patients and should not be performed for PVC or pacing fluctuations. 7 Atrial flutter cannot be detected by the atrial fibrillation algorithm because most of their RR intervals are regular. 8 In following situations, atrial fibrillation alarm detection error may occur:  Sinus arrhythmia  Atrioventricular block  Frequent ventricular premature beats  Myoelectric interference  Electrode motion artifact PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.9.2 ARR Analysis Menu 9.9.2.1 Switching ARR Analysis On and Off To switch ARR Analysis on or off, in the ECG Setup menu, select ARR Analysis to toggle between On and Off from the popup interface. 9.9.2.2 ARR Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > ARR Analysis > ARR Alarm Setup to change the following ARR alarm  Separately switch on or off each arrhythmia alarm and set the alarm level.  Select All Alarms On/All Alarms Off to switch on or off all arrhythmia alarms except key ARR alarms.  Set the threshold of certain arrhythmia alarms. When an arrhythmia exceeds its threshold, an alarm will be triggered.  Select Default to restore the ARR alarm settings to factory defaults. Confirm the changes to make the settings effective. V-Fib/V-Tach, ExtremeTachy, ExtremeBrady, V-Tach and Vent Brady are key ARR alarms and they are preset to be on. The user can switch on/off those key ARR alarms only when Key ARR Alarm Switch Authority is enabled. To enable the authority, 1. Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain, and enter the required password. 2. Select Alarm Setup and set Key ARR Alarm Switch Authority to On. If any of key ARR alarms is switched off, the bottom information area will prompt Key ARR Alarm Off. Clicking the prompts can view the details. Asystole and Sustain VT alarms are preset to On and cannot be turned off. When the ARR alarm is set to Off, the monitor won’t give an alarm prompt even if an alarm occurs. In order to avoid endangering the patient’s life, the user should use this function cautiously. Pacer not Capture and Pacer not Pacing alarms are available only when Pace is set to 9.9.2.3 Adjustable Range of ARR Alarm Threshold ARR Alarm Range PVCs High 1/min to 99/min Pause 2 s, 2.5 s, 3 s PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG ARR Alarm Range ExtremeTachy Adult: 120 bpm to 300 bpm; Pediatric/neonatal: 120 bpm to 350 bpm PAC Bigeminy 3/min to 50/min PAC Trigeminy Pauses/min High 1/min to 20/min Sustain VT 15 s to 45 s ExtremeBrady 15 bpm to 60 bpm Low Voltage(Limb) 0.3 mV to 0.8 mV 9.9.2.4 ARR Selflearning Pick this item ARR Selflearn to start a learning procedure, and ECG ARR Learning is displayed on the screen. The ARR selflearning will start automatically in the following status:  Switching the ARR Analysis from Off to On;  Changing patient type or electrode type;  Connecting or Switching calculation leads;  Changing pacemaker status;  Exiting DEMO or Standby mode;  Admitting a patient;  Switching calibration mode into normal measurement mode;  Switching the ECG parameter on;  Changing-over between basic ARR and advanced ARR. 1 During the relearning phase of the algorithm, arrhythmia detection may not be available. So you should closely monitor the patient condition during and for several minutes after the learning phase to allow the algorithm to reach optimal detection performance. 2 Take care to initiate ARR selflearning only during periods of predominantly normal rhythm and when ECG signal is relatively noise-free. If ARR selflearning takes place during arrhythmia, the ectopics may be incorrectly learned as normal QRS complex. This may result in missed detection of subsequent events of arrhythmia. 3 If ARR selflearning is performed during ventricular rhythm, ventricular heartbeats may be erroneously identified as normal QRS complexes. This may lead to missed ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation events. Due to this reason, you should: 1) Take care that ARR selflearning may start automatically; 2) Response to lead off information; PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 3) Always check the correctness of arrhythmia alarm. 9.10 QT Analysis* *Not available in U.S.A. The QT interval is the time from the beginning of Q wave to the end of T wave. It measured the total duration of the depolarization (QRS duration) and repolarization (ST-T) phases of ventricular action potential. QT analysis can help detect extended QT interval syndrome. 9.10.1 Measurement Limitations The following clinical status of the patient may affect the QT analysis, and the inaccurate measurement may but is not limited to the following reasons:  The T-wave is very flat  Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation make T wave is difficult to define  The end of the T-wave is difficult to define because of the presence of U-waves  A high heart rate causes the P-wave to encroach on the end of the previous T-wave  Noise or the QRS wave variation is too big In these cases, the user should choose a lead with good T wave amplitude and no visible oscillations, and without a dominant U wave or P wave. In some conditions, such as left or right bundle branch block or cardiac hypertrophy causes broaden QRS complex. If long QTc is observed, verify it to ensure that it is not caused by QRS broadening. Since normal beats followed by ventricular beats are not included in the analysis, QT measurement could not be carried out when there was bigeminy rhythm. When the heart rate changes, it may take several minutes for the QT interval to stabilize. In order to obtain reliable QTc calculations, it is important to avoid areas where the heart rate changes. QT/QTc measurements should always be validated by a qualified clinician. 9.10.2 Switching QT Analysis On and Off To switch QT Analysis on or off, in the ECG Setup menu, select QT Analysis to toggle between On and Off from the popup interface. 9.10.3 QT Display The following figure is QT display for your reference only. The graphics on your monitor may be slightly different. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.10.4 Selecting QT Analysis Lead There are two modes for selection: All lead: Use all available leads (expect pressurized the limb lead) to produce an overall QT measurement, user can select ALL through ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Analysis Lead. Single lead: QT measurements were performed using all available single leads (except the pressurized limb lead). User selects any lead in Analysis Lead menu to enter into single lead 9.10.5 Selecting Calculation Formula The monitor uses Bazett formula to correct QT values by default. There are four alternative formulas: Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham and Hodges. Hodges: QTc  QT  1.75  (HR  60) Bazett: QTc  QT   Fridericia: QTc  QT   Framingham: QTc  QT  154  (1  ) 9.10.6 Setting QT Baseline To quantitatively express the QTc values change, the user can set a QTc baseline, the baseline is used for calculating ΔQTc value. The user can set the baseline through ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Save Baseline, and the monitor displays The Baseline is saved at: (Time). If no baseline has been set, the first five minute QTc value after the QT measurement begins will be automatically set as the baseline. If a new baseline is set, the previous baseline is discarded. Because ΔQTc alarm is based on the difference of the baseline with the current values, inappropriate baseline settings may lead that no ΔQTc alarm is generated. The QT baseline will be cleared in following situations: 1) Turning off the monitor; 2) Changing the electrode type; 3) Changing the calculation lead in 3 electrodes; 4) Changing the patient type; 5) Admitting new patients; 6) Enters or exits Demo mode. If QT analysis is needed, please reset the baseline. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.10.7 QTc Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Alarm Setup to change the following QT alarm settings:  Separately switch on or off QTc alarm and ΔQTc alarm and set the alarm level.  Set the thresholds of QTc alarm and ΔQTc alarm. When QTc value or ΔQTc value exceeds the preset thresholds, an alarm will be triggered. 9.10.8 QT View To enter QT view, please select ECG Setup > QT Analysis > QT View. In the QT View interface, the color of current QT segment and QT value are consistent with the color of HR. The color of baseline and QT value are yellow. In the QT View interface, the user can save QT baseline through clicking Save as Base when QT values gets stable. If no QT baseline is saved, the monitor automatically saves the baseline when the first five minutes value appears. Besides, the user can record and print the QT view. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring RESP Chapter 10 Monitoring RESP 10.1 Overview The monitor measures respiration from the amount of thoracic impedance between two ECG electrodes. The change of impedance between the two electrodes, (due to the thoracic movement), produces a respiratory waveform on the screen. 10.2 RESP Safety Information 1 If you do not set the Hold High and Hold Low for the respiration correctly in manual detection mode, it may not be possible for the monitor to detect apnea. If you set the Hold High and Hold Low too low, the monitor is more likely to detect cardiac activity, and to falsely interpret cardiac activity as respiratory activity in the case of apnea. 2 Respiration measurements can not detect all underexposure sudden events, nor can they distinguish between central, obstructive and mixed respiratory asphyxial events. It only prompts alarm in a predetermined time if the last breath is detected and the next breath is not detected, so it can not be used for diagnostic purposes. 3 If operating under conditions according to the EMC Standard EN 60601-1-2 (Radiated Immunity 3 V/m), field strengths above 3 V/m may cause erroneous measurements at various frequencies. Therefore it is recommended to avoid the use of electrically radiating equipment in close proximity to the respiration measurement unit. 4 Cardiogenic artifact in impedance respiration monitoring may make it difficult to detect breaths or may otherwise be counted as breaths. In some instances, the breath rate may also correspond to the heart rate making it difficult to determine if the signal is due to breathing or the cardiac cycle. Do not rely on RESP monitoring as the sole method for detecting cessation of breathing. Follow hospital guidelines and best clinical practices for apnea detection including monitoring additional parameters that indicate the patient’s oxygenation status, such as EtCO and SpO . 5 For the diagnosis of apnea, especially in premature infants and infants, the safety and effectiveness of respiration measurements have not been validated. 6 To monitor the respiration, only non-ESU-proof accessories can be used. This is because the internal impedance of the ESU-proof accessories required to be used for electrosurgical operation is too large. 7 Some implantable pacemakers can adjust their triggering frequency according to the \"minute ventilation rate.\" Impedance respiration measurements may cause these pacemakers to react incorrectly. To prevent this, turn off the respiration measurement. 8 In manual detection mode, after changing the gain of the respiration wave, be sure to check the setting of hold high and hold low. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring RESP 9 When ECG electrode is placed on patient’s limb, the impedance respiration may be unreliable. 10 Respiration measurement cannot be performed when ESU is used. 11 RESP Apnea alarm is based on inadequate thoracic impedance change. 12 RESP Apnea alarm should not be used or relied upon while the patient is unattended. The RESP monitoring is not recommended to be used on patients who are very active, as this can cause false alarms. 10.3 Electrode Placement for Monitoring RESP Correct patient skin preparation techniques for electrode placement are important for RESP measurement: you will find this information in the chapter on ECG. The RESP signal is always measured between two of the ECG electrodes. There are two standard ECG leads for selection: I lead (RA and LA) and II lead (RA and LL). Electrodes Placement for 5 Electrodes 10.4 Cardiac Overlay Cardiac activity that affects the RESP waveform is called cardiac overlay. It happens when the RESP electrodes pick up impedance changes caused by the rhythmic blood flow. Correct electrode placement can help to reduce cardiac overlay: avoid the liver area and the ventricles of the heart in the line between the respiratory electrodes. This is particularly important for 10.5 Chest Expansion Some patients, especially neonates, expand their chests laterally. In these cases it is best to place PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring RESP the two respiratory electrodes in the right midaxillary and left lateral chest areas at the patient’s maximum point of breathing movement to optimize the respiratory wave. 10.6 Abdominal Breathing Some patients with restricted chest movement breathe mainly abdominally. In these cases, you may need to place the left leg electrode on the left abdomen at the point of maximum abdominal expansion to optimize the respiratory wave. Place the red and green electrodes diagonally to optimize the respiration waveform. Avoid the liver area and the ventricles of the heart in the line between the RESP electrodes so as to avoid cardiac overlay or artifacts from pulsating blood flow. This is particularly important for neonates. 10.7 Selecting RESP Lead To change RESP lead, in the RESP Setup menu, select RESP Lead to pick up the appropriate lead from the pop-up list. 10.8 Changing Hold Type To change the calculation mode, in the RESP Setup menu, set Hold Type to Manual or Auto. When it is set to the AUTO mode, Hold High and Hold Low are unavailable, and the monitor can calculate the respiration rate automatically. When it is set to the Manual mode, you can adjust the broken lines in RESP area by the Hold High and Hold Low items. 10.9 Changing the Size and Speed of the Respiration Wave Select the RESP waveform area to open the RESP Wave Setup menu:  Select AMP, and choose an appropriate value. The bigger the value is, the higher the waveform amplitude will be.  Select Sweep: select an appropriate setting from the pop-up list. 10.10 Changing the Apnea Alarm Time The apnea alarm is a high priority red alarm used to detect apneas. The apnea alarm delay time defines the time period between the point where the monitor cannot detect any respiration activity and the indication of the apnea alarm. Users should set it cautiously. 1. In the RESP Setup menu, select Apnea Alm. 2. Select the appropriate setting from the popup list. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO Chapter 11 Monitoring SpO 11.1 Overview SpO is used to measure arterial blood oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of oxyhemoglobin in the arterial blood. SpO parameter can also provide pulse rate (PR) and a plethysmogram wave (Pleth). SpO socket 11.2 SpO Safety Information 1 Do not use the SpO sensors if the packaging or the sensor is damaged and return them to the vendor. 2 If the SpO sensor cannot work properly, please reconnect the sensor or change a 3 Correct and proper sensor application: if the sensor is too loose, it might compromise the optical alignment, and even cause the sensor to fall off. If the sensor is too tight, (such as the application site is too large or becomes too large due to edema), excessive pressure and local tissue ischemia, hypoxia and lack of nutrition may occur on the application site. Prolonged and continuous monitoring may increase the risk of Skin irritations or lacerations. To avoid these damages, users should periodically check surrounding skin of application site according to the patient's condition and pressure sensor, inspect the if there is sign of stress-related damage in surrounding tissue, and regularly change the application site. For the patients whose fluid is easy to transfer and/or the patients with systemic or localized edema, users should inspect the skin and change application site more frequently. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO 4 Use only sensors permitted by the manufacturer and extension cables with the monitor. Other sensors or extension cables may cause improper monitor performance and/or minor personal injury. 5 High oxygen levels may predispose a premature infant to retrolental fibroplasia. If this is a consideration do NOT set the high alarm limit to 100%, which is equivalent to switching the high limit alarm off. 6 When serious arrhythmia is present, the SpO pulse rate may differ from ECG heart rate but this does not indicate an inaccurate PR (SpO ) value. 7 Misapplied sensor or sensor that becomes partially dislodged may cause either over or under reading of actual arterial oxygen saturation. 1 Avoid placing the sensor on extremities with an arterial catheter, intravascular venous infusion line, or inflated NIBP cuff. When measuring SpO on the limb with inflated NIBP cuff, please turn on the NIBP Simul function. 2 When a trend toward patient deoxygenation is indicated, analyze the blood samples with a laboratory co-oximeter to completely understand the patient’s condition. 3 SpO waveform is not directly proportional to the pulse volume. 4 The device is calibrated to display functional oxygen saturation. 5 A Functional tester or simulator can not be used to assess the SpO accuracy. However, it can be used to demonstrate that a particular monitor reproduces a calibration curve that has been independently demonstrated to meet a particular 6 If the surrounding temperature increases, the operator should pay attention to the site of poor perfusion, and increase the frequency of checking the skin and changing the measurement site to prevent burns. If the initial skin temperature is less than 35°C, the temperature of all the listed sensors on the skin will not exceed 41°C during 7 The cumulative use time for the SpO sensor in a single patient should be less than 11.3 Measuring SpO 1. Select the correct patient category setting (adult/pediatric and neonatal), as this is used to optimize the calculation of the SpO and pulse numerics. 2. During measurement, ensure that the application site: – has a pulsatile flow, ideally with a good circulation perfusion. – has not changed in its thickness, causing an improper fit of the sensor. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO Measurement Procedure 1. Switch on the monitor. 2. Attach the sensor to the appropriate site of the patient. Before Applying the Sensor: Be sure to understand all warnings listed in the previous section before applying any sensor to a patient. Also, check the sensor as follows:  Check the sensor outside and inside. To inspect the inside, gently open the sensor cavity and check splits on or next to the transparent silicone that covers the optical elements.  Any sensor showing signs of damage or alteration must not be used for further patient monitoring; instead, dispose of it using proper disposal procedures. Applying Finger/Soft-tip Sensors:  Nip the clamp, and choose a site that is well perfused and restricts a conscious patient’s movements least. The ring finger of the non-dominate hand is preferred. Alternatively, the other fingers on the non-dominate hand may be used.  The big toe or long toe (next to the big toe) may be used on restrained patients or patients whose hands are unavailable.  Place the finger into the sensor according to the direction of the symbol on the sensor. Adjust the finger to ensure that the pad of the finger completely covers the sensor detection window.  Orient the sensor so that the cable will be running towards the top of the patient’s hand.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). Applying Neonatal Finger (or Toe) Wrap Sensors:  When you perform the measurement, position the sensor over the hand or foot with optical components opposite each other.  Hold the sensor, and insert stretched strap into slot, hold it there while threading end through latch. If strap is too long, thread it through second latch.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO Applying Adult/Pediatric Ear Clip Sensor:  When you perform the measurement, clip the plastic fixing part on top of the ear; reinforce it to prevent falling off or getting loose.  Clip the probe onto fleshy part of the lobe with optical components opposite to each other.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). 3. Plug the connector of the sensor extension cable into the SpO socket on XM module or V- SpO module. Inspect the application site every two to three hours to ensure skin quality and correct optical alignment. If the skin quality changes, move the sensor to another site. Change the application site at least every four hours. For neonate, change the measuring site every 20 minutes. 1 Injected dyes such as methylene blue or intravascular dyshemoglobins such as methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin may lead to inaccurate measurements. 2 Inspect the sensor to ensure that the light emitter and receiver are aligned with each other and there is no gap between the sensor and the finger. All the light emitted by the light emitter must pass through the patient's tissue. The sensor cable should be placed on the back of the hand. 3 Clean and remove any substances such as nail polish from the application site. Periodically check to ensure that the sensor remains properly positioned on the 11.4 Measurement Limitations Certain patient conditions can affect the measurements or cause the loss of the pulse signal. Inaccurate measurements can be caused but not limited by:  incorrect sensor application  high levels of ambient light sources, such as surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, and direct sunlight  failure to cover the sensor with opaque material in high levels of ambient light conditions PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO  dysfunctional hemoglobins  low peripheral perfusion  excessive or violent patient movement  venous pulsations  intravascular dyes, such as indocyanine green or methylene blue  externally applied coloring agents (nail polish, dye, pigmented cream)  defibrillation  placement of the sensor on an extremity with a blood pressure cuff, arterial catheter, or intravascular line  electromagnetic interference Loss of pulse signal can occur for the following reasons:  the sensor is applied too tightly  a blood pressure cuff is inflated on the same extremity as the one with the sensor attached  there is arterial occlusion proximal to the sensor  low peripheral perfusion 1 To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the sensor is properly applied, and cover the sensor site with opaque material. 2 Adjacent SpO sensors may interfere with each other (eg, multiple SpO measurements in the same patient). Be sure to cover the sensor with opaque material to reduce cross-interference. 3 Move the sensor to a less active site, and keep the patient still, if possible. 4 For Nellcor SpO module, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required for measuring SpO and PR depending on the measurement conditions. During normal measurement conditions the averaging time is 6 to 7 seconds. During conditions such as those caused by low perfusion, interference (e.g., external interference such as ambient light or patient movement), or a combination of these, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required beyond 7 seconds. If the resulting dynamic averaging time exceeds 20 seconds, the screen will display prompt message “SpO Search Pulse” and SpO and PR will continue to be updated every second. As these conditions extend, the amount of data required continues to increase. If the dynamic averaging time reaches 40 seconds, the screen will display high-level alarm message “SpO No Pulse” indicating a loss-of-pulse condition. 11.5 Assessing the Validity of a SpO Reading You can check the quality of the pleth wave and the stability of the SpO values to assess whether the sensor functions properly and whether the SpO readings are valid. Always use these two indications simultaneously to assess the validity of a SpO reading. Generally, the quality of the SpO pleth wave reflects the quality of the light signals obtained by the sensor. A wave of poor quality manifests a decline of the signal validity. On the other hand, the stability of the SpO values also reflects the signal quality. Different from varying SpO PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO readings caused by physiological factors, unstable SpO readings are resulted from the sensor’s receiving signals with interference. The problems mentioned above may be caused by patient movement, wrong sensor placement or sensor malfunction. To obtain valid SpO readings, try to limit patient movement, check the placement of the sensor, measure another site or replace the 1 The SpO accuracy has been validated in controlled human studies against arterial blood sample reference measured with a CO-oximeter. SpO measurements are statistically distributed, only about two-thirds of the measurements can be expected to fall within the specified accuracy compared to CO-oximeter measurements. The volunteer population in the studies are composed of healthy men and women from age 19 to 37 (for ELITECH SpO module), from 18 to 50 (for Nellcor SpO module), with various skin pigmentations. Note that the study population was healthy adults and not in the actual intended use population. 2 The pulse rate accuracy is obtained by comparison to the pulse rate generated with an arterial oxygen simulator (also an electronic pulse simulator). 3 During monitoring, if the monitor's reading differs significantly from the patient's physiological condition, it indicates that the signal may be disturbed, resulting in an inaccurate reading. In this case, the artifact can disguise as a similar reading, causing the monitor to fail to send an alarm. In order to ensure reliable monitoring, it is necessary to regularly check whether the sensor is wearing properly and the signal quality is good. 11.6 SpO Alarm Delay There is a delay between a physiological event at the measurement site and the corresponding alarm at the monitor. This delay has two components: 1. The time between the occurrence of the physiological event and when this event is represented by the displayed numerical values. This delay depends on the algorithmic processing time and the sensitivity setting. The lower the sensitivity configured, the longer the time needed until the numerical values reflect the physiological event. 2. The time between the displayed numerical values exceeding an alarm limit and the alarm indication on the monitor. This delay is the combination of the configured alarm delay time plus the general system delay time. 11.7 Perfusion Index (PI)* * Only applicable to the ELITECH SpO module. PI is a numeric value indicating perfusion level. It reflects the perfusion level at the monitoring As the measurement of SpO is based on the pulsation caused by the blood flow through the vessel, PI is in relation to the strength of the pulse. Also, you can use PI as a signal quality indicator for the measurement of SpO . PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO PI is indicated by a value ranging from 0 to 10. The bigger the value is, the better the perfusion and the signal quality will be. The perfusion level and the signal quality are at their maximum when the value reaches 10. When PI is below 2, it indicates the low perfusion and the poor signal quality at the monitoring site; you need to reposition the sensor or find a better site. The PI value will be displayed in the SpO parameter area. 11.8 Measuring SpO and NIBP Simultaneously While measuring SpO and NIBP on the same limb simultaneously, the user can set NIBP Simul to On in SpO Setup menu to lock the SpO alarm status until the NIBP measurement ends. If NIBP Simul is set to Off, low perfusion caused by NIBP measurement may lead to inaccurate SpO readings and therefore cause false physiological alarms. 11.9 Setting Pitch Tone If tone modulation is on, the PR sound lowers when the SpO level drops. In the SpO Setup menu, select pitch tone to toggle between On and Off. 11.10 Setting Sensitivity The different sensitivity indicates different refresh frequency. High indicates the refresh frequency of SpO value is the most frequent. To change the sensitivity, please follow the steps: 1 Select the SpO Setup menu; 2 Select Sensitivity on the interface and select the desired sensitivity from the popup list. 11.11 SatSeconds Alarm Management* * Only applicable to the Nellcor SpO module. 11.11.1 Describing SatSeconds With traditional alarm management, upper and lower alarm limits are set for monitoring oxygen saturation. During monitoring, as soon as an alarm limit is violated by as little as one percentage point, an alarm is immediately triggered. When the SpO level fluctuates near an alarm limit, the alarm is triggered each time the limit is violated. Such frequent alarms can be distracting. With the SatSeconds technique, upper and lower SpO alarm limits are set in the same way as traditional alarm management. However, you can also set a SatSeconds limit that allows monitoring of SpO below the selected lower alarm limit and above the selected upper alarm limit for a period of time before an alarm is triggered. The method of calculation is as follows: The number of percentage points that the SpO falls outside the alarm limit is multiplied by the number of seconds that the SpO level remains outside that limit. This can be stated as an Points × Seconds = SatSeconds PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO Points = SpO percentage points outside of the limit Seconds = number of seconds that SpO remains at that point outside of the limit The alarm response time, assuming a SatSeconds limit set at 50 and a lower alarm limit set at 90, is described and illustrated below. In this example, the SpO level drops to 88 (2 points below the limit) and remains there for a period of 2 seconds (2 points × 2 seconds = 4 SatSeconds). The SpO then drops to 86 for 3 seconds and then to 84 for 6 seconds. The resulting SatSeconds values are shown below: SpO Seconds SatSeconds 4 × 3 = 12 6 × 6 = 36 Total SatSeconds = 52 After approximately 10.7 seconds, a SatSeconds alarm will be triggered, because the limit of 50 SatSeconds has been exceeded. See arrow (↑) in the following figure. Alarm Response with SatSeconds Saturation levels may fluctuate rather than remaining steady for a period of several seconds. Often, the patient SpO may fluctuate above and below the alarm limit, re-entering the non-alarm range several times. During such fluctuation, the monitor integrates the number of SpO points, both positive and negative, until either the SatSeconds limit is reached, or the patient SpO returns within a normal range and remains there. 11.11.2 SatSeconds “Safety Net” The SatSeconds “Safety Net” is for patients whose saturation makes frequent excursions below or above the SpO limit but does not remain in violation long enough for the SatSeconds limit to be reached. If three or more SpO alarm limit violations occur within a 60-second period, an alarm will be triggered even if the SatSeconds limit has not been reached. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring SpO 11.11.3 Setting SatSeconds Duration You can set SatSeconds to Off or to the duration among 10, 25, 50 and 100. To configure the SatSeconds settings, enter the SpO Setup menu and select the desired SatSeconds setting from the SatSeconds list. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring PR Chapter 12 Monitoring PR 12.1 Overview The pulse numeric counts the arterial pulsations that result from the mechanical activity of the heart in beats per minute (bpm). You can obtain a pulse from any measured SpO signal or any arterial pressure. 12.2 Setting PR Source The monitor provides PR source options. You can select SpO or arterial pressure labels as the PR source in the PR Source list on the PR Setup menu. In the PR Source list, an arterial pressure label accompanied with a label with brackets indicates this label is in conflict. Do not select a conflicting label as the PR source. 12.3 Setting PR Volume Select PR Setup > PR Volume, then select the appropriate setting for the PR volume: five bars represent the maximum volume and one bar represents the minimum volume. If none of bars are selected, the PR volume will be off. Beat frequency of pulse has positive correlation with measurement value. 12.4 Selecting the Active Alarm Source In most cases, the HR and PR numerics are identical. In order to avoid simultaneous alarms on HR and PR, the monitor uses either ECG or PR as its active alarm source. To change the alarm source, select either ECG Setup > Alarm Source or PR Setup > Alarm Source, then select  HR: if you want HR to be the active alarm source.  PR: If you select PR as the active alarm source, the monitor will prompt you to confirm your choice. Be aware that if you select PR as the alarm source, ECG HR alarms are switched off.  AUTO: If the Alarm Source is set to Auto, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the alarm source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on and at least one ECG lead can be measured without a technical alarm condition. The monitor will automatically switch to PR for the alarm source if:  a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and  a PR source is switched on and available. The monitor uses the pulse rate from the currently active measurement as system pulse. While PR is the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are switched off. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as alarm source. Pulse alarms are only generated when the active alarm source is set to PR, a pulse source is set as system pulse and pulse alarms are switched on. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP Chapter 13 Monitoring NIBP 13.1 Overview This monitor uses the oscillometric method for measuring NIBP. It can be used for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients. It is also intended for use with pregnant, including pre-eclamptic Oscillometric devices measure the amplitude of pressure changes in the occluding cuff as the cuff deflates from above systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks through the occlusion in the artery. As the cuff pressure decreases further, the pulsations increase in amplitude, reach a maximum (which approximates to the mean pressure), and then diminish. The blood pressure measurements determined with this device comply with the American National Standard for Electronic or Automated Sphygmomanometers (ISO 81060-2:2013) in relation to mean error and standard deviation. In clinical investigation method with a reference sphygmomanometer, the fifth Korotkoff sound was used to determine adult diastolic pressure, and the fourth Korotkoff sound was used to determine pediatric diastolic pressure. The invasive blood pressure is used to determine the neonate pressure in clinical investigation, and the arterial reference sites include umbilical artery, arteria cruralis, axillary artery, brachial artery, dorsalis pedis, and radial artery. NIBP start/ stop key Connector for NIBP cuff 13.2 NIBP Safety Information 1 Do not measure NIBP on patients with sickle-cell disease or any condition where skin damage has occurred or is expected. 2 Do not measure NIBP on the arm of the same side with a mastectomy. 3 Use clinical judgment to decide whether to perform frequent blood pressure measurements on patients with severe blood clotting disorders because of the risk of hematoma in the limb fitted with the cuff. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 4 Do not apply the cuff to a limb that has an intravenous infusion or catheter in place. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when infusion is slowed or blocked during cuff inflation. 5 Do not attach the cuff to a limb being used for IV infusions as the cuff inflation can block the infusion, potentially causing harm to patient. 6 Do not apply the cuff to a limb where intravascular access or therapy, or an arterio- venous (A-V) shunt is present, otherwise, it may result in injury to the patient. 7 Ensure that the correct patient type is selected before performing measurements. Do not apply the higher adult inflation, overpressure limits and measurement duration for neonatal patients. Not using the neonate mode on a neonatal patient can block the blood flow, potentially causing harm to the patient. 8 Make sure that the air conduit connecting the blood pressure cuff and the monitor is neither blocked nor tangled. 9 Measuring of blood pressure can temporarily cause malfunctioning of other medical monitoring devices on the same limb. 10 NIBP readings can be affected by the measurement site, the position of the patient, exercise, or the patient's physiologic conditions. 11 Continuous cuff pressure due to connection tubing kinking can block the blood flow, and may result in injury to the patient. 12 Verifying the calibration is only applicable for adults, and it can not be operated in automatic measuring interval. Continuous measuring can not be operated in automatic measuring interval either. 1 It is suggested that the user should not start NIBP measuring when the low battery displays, or the monitor may be turned off automatically. 2 If you spill liquid onto the equipment or accessories, particularly if there is a chance that it can get inside the tubing or the measurement device, contact your service personnel. 3 Continuous use of the automatic measuring mode for short intervals may lead to the discomfort of patient. Continuous measuring and automatic measuring in neonatal or pediatric mode may result in tissue damage or ischemia to the patient. 4 NIBP measurement can be affected by extremes of temperature, humidity and 5 NIBP measurement value should be explained by qualified professionals. 6 The pulse rate based on the NIBP measurement may differ from the heart rate based on the ECG waveform. NIBP measures the number of peripheral pulse pulsations, PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP and the heart rate is measured by the electrical signal of the heart. When the electrical signals of the heart occasionally fail to cause the peripheral blood vessels to pulse or the patient's peripheral perfusion is poor, the difference happens. 7 The cumulative use time for the NIBP cuff in a single patient should be less than 30 13.3 Measurement Limitations Measurements are impossible with pulse rate extremes of less than 40 bpm or greater than 240 bpm, or if the patient is on a heart-lung machine. The measurement may be inaccurate or impossible in the following situations:  A regular arterial pressure pulse is hard to detect.  Patients with cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients with excessive and continuous movement such as shivering or convulsions.  Patients with rapid blood pressure changes.  Patients with severe shock or hypothermia that reduces blood flow to the peripheries.  Patients with obesity, where a thick layer of fat surrounding a limb dampens the oscillations coming from the artery.  Patients on an edematous extremity. 13.4 Measurement Methods There are four methods of measuring NIBP:  Manual - measurement on demand.  Auto - continually repeated measurements (between 1 and 480 minute adjustable interval). The interval can be user defined, and the default interval of user defined is 2.5 minutes. After the first measurement starts manually, the monitor will automatically measure NIBP as preset interval. When the measurement interval is set to 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 360 min and 480 min, the system will automatically adjust the next measurement time. Here’s an example. Auto Measurement Interval Current Time Next Measurement Time 5 min 12:02 12:05, 12:10, 12:15, 12:20, and so forth. 10 min 12:02 12:10, 12:20, 12:30, 12:40, and so forth. 15 min 12:02 12:15, 12:30, 12: 45, 13:00, and so forth. 30 min 12:02 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, and so forth. 60 min 12:02 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00, and so forth. 90 min 12:02 13:00, 14:30, 16:00, 17:30, and so forth. 120 min 12:02 13:00, 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, and so forth. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 180 min 12:02 13:00, 16:00, 19:00, 22:00, and so forth. 240 min 12:02 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, and so forth. 360 min 12:02 13:00, 19:00, 1:00, 7:00, and so forth. 480 min 12:02 13:00, 21:00, 5:00, 13:00, and so forth. When the completion time of manual measurement to the first hourly time is less than or equal to 30 seconds, the measurement will not be performed at the first hourly time, and the first automatic measurement will be delayed to the next hourly time.  Continuous- the measurement will run consecutively in five minutes, then the monitor enters manual mode.  Sequence- the measurement will preformed at needed phases as preset intervals, after the first measurement starts manually, the monitor will automatically measure NIBP as preset phase and interval. The phase can be selected as 4, 5 and 6. The interval can be set as 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 360 min, and 480 min. The user can also set the measurement times in each phase, there are several selections: Off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, Continuous and Off. Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurements in Auto, Continuous or Sequence mode may be associated with purpura, ischemia and neuropathy in the limb wearing the cuff. When monitoring a patient, examine the extremities of the limb frequently for normal color, warmth and sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop the blood pressure measurements. 13.5 Measurement Procedures To obtain accurate measurements, the following operating steps need to be observed: 1. Ensure the patient position in normal use, including  Comfortably seated or lie flat, legs uncrossed;  Feet flat on the floor  Back and arm supported  Relax as much as possible, neither talking nor applying external pressure against the cuff. Rest for five minutes in a quiet environment. 2. Connect the air hose to the connector on XM module and switch on the monitor. Apply the blood pressure cuff to the patient's arm or leg and follow the instructions below. -Ensure that the cuff is completely deflated.  -Apply the appropriate size cuff to the patient (About the cuff size selection, please refer to Section NIBP Accessories), and make sure that the symbol \"Φ\" is over the artery. Ensure that PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP the middle of the cuff at the level of the right atrium of the heart and the cuff is not wrapped too tightly around the limb. Excessive tightness may cause discoloration and eventual ischemia of the extremity. Cuff Usage 3. Check whether the patient type is appropriately selected. Access the Patient Setup menu from Menu. Turn the knob to select the required patient Type in the Patient Info. menu. 4. Select a measurement mode and unit (mmHg, kPa or cmH O, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa, 1 mmHg=1.36 cmH O) in the NIBP Setup menu. Refer to Section Operation Prompts for 5. Press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the screen to start a measurement. 6. Wait until the first reading is taken. 1 The width of the cuff is either approximately 40% of the limb circumference or 2/3 of the upper arm length. The inflatable part of the cuff should be long enough to encircle 80%-100% of the limb. The wrong size of cuff can cause erroneous readings. If the cuff size is in question, use another cuff with suitable size to avoid errors. 2 If an NIBP measurement is suspect, repeat the measurement. If you are still uncertain about the reading, use another method to measure the blood pressure. 3 Please make sure the cuff is well connected. A leak of air may cause measurement 4 Please select the cuff with the suitable size. An unsuitable cuff may cause incorrect measurements. 5 Avoid incursion of liquid into the cuff. If this happens, please desiccate the cuff completely. 13.5.1 Operation Prompts 1. Manual Measuring Access the NIBP Setup menu and set the Measure Mode item to Manual.

Stopping continuous measurement During continuous measurement, press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the screen at any time to stop measurement. 13.5.2 Correcting the Measurement if Limb is not at Heart Level To correct the measurement if the limb is not at heart level to the displayed value: Add 0.75 mmHg (0.10 kPa) for each centimeter Deduct 0.75 mmHg (0.10 kPa) for each higher or centimeter lower or Add 1.9 mmHg (0.25 kPa) for each inch higher Deduct 1.9 mmHg (0.25 kPa) for each inch 13.6 NIBP Multi-Review Window To set the display of NIBP measurements, select NIBP Setup > Review:  When it is set to On, a window for NIBP measurements will be displayed at the waveform area on the main interface, and the size of this window varies depending on the numbers of displayed waveforms.  When it is set to Off, the window is unavailable on the screen. 13.7 Resetting NIBP When the pressure does not work properly and the system fails to give a message for the problem, pick Reset in the User Maintain > NIBP Maintain menu to activate self-test procedure, and thus restore the system from abnormal performance. 13.8 Calibrating NIBP NIBP is not user-calibrated. Cuff-pressure transducers must be verified and calibrated, if necessary, at least once every two years by a qualified service professional. See the Service Manual for details. 13.9 Leakage Test Leakage test is used to detect the air tightness of the NIBP pump, valve, and trachea. If not, the PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP system will display NIBP leakage. NIBP leak detection should be performed at least once every two years or when you think the measurement is inaccurate. This leakage test other than being specified in the ISO81060-1 standard is to be used by the user to simply determine whether there are air leaks in the NIBP airway. If at the end of the test the system gives the prompt that the NIBP airway has air leaks, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Procedure of Leakage Test 1. Connect the cuff securely with the socket for NIBP air hole. 2. Wrap the cuff around the cylinder of an appropriate size; don’t wrap the cuff around limbs. 3. Make sure the patient type has been set to Adult. 4. Access User Maintain > NIBP Maintain. 5. Select Leakage Test. Then the prompt Leak. Test Running will appear indicating that the system has started the leakage test. For Omron module: The system will automatically inflate the pneumatic system to 285 mmHg. After 4 minutes, the system will automatically open the deflating valve, which marks the completion of a pneumatic measurement. For ELITECH module: The system will automatically inflate the pneumatic system to about 180 mmHg. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, if system leakage has detected, the system will automatically open the deflating valve to stop the leak test and indicates NIBP Leak. If no system leakage is detected when the pneumatic system is inflated to 180 mmHg, the system will perform a deflation to an approximate value of 40 mmHg and subsequently perform the second phase leak test. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, the system will automatically open the deflating valve and provide corresponding indication based on the test result. For SunTech Module: When applying high pressures; take special care to increase the pressure at a rate that will not cause unwanted overpressure errors (300 mmHg). Manually inflate the pneumatic system to approximately 250 mmHg. Start the timer and wait 60 seconds for the pneumatic system to reach its pressure equilibrium point. After the waiting period, record the pneumatic pressure level (P1) and wait another 60 seconds and record the pneumatic pressure level again (P2). Safety circuitry on the module only allows the pressure in the pneumatic system to remain above 10mmHg for 180 seconds. When this safety time limit is exceeded, the valves will open releasing the pressure. Subtract P2 from P1 and this is the leak rate per minute. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 6. If the alarm information NIBP Leak appears, it indicates that the airway may have air leaks. In this case, the user should check for loose connection. After confirming secure connections, the user should re-perform the leakage test. If the failure prompt still appears, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Diagram of NIBP Air Leakage Test 13.10 Setting Inflation Mode To change the inflation mode: 1. Select NIBP Setup > Inflation Mode; 2. Choose Manual or AUTO from the pull-down list.  If Manual is chosen, the preset value by users will be adopted as the inflation value when measuring blood pressure.  If AUTO is chosen, the default value will be adopted as the inflation value when measuring blood pressure. 13.11 Cleaning Mode The cleaning mode can remove the dust and foreign matters in the air valve to ensure the accuracy of NIBP measurement. To start the cleaning mode, please select User Maintain > NIBP Maintain > Cleaning Mode, the monitor displays: Be sure the cuff is disconnected from monitor, after confirmation and clicking Start Cleaning button, cleaning mode starts. The cleaning mode lasts three minutes. In this mode, the monitor displays Cleaning in progress, the remaining time of cleaning mode and cuff value are also displayed. When the counting down finishes, the monitor exits cleaning mode automatically, if the user needs to exit the cleaning mode in advance, please click Stop button. When the air pressure is abnormal, the monitor will automatically turn off the cleaning mode and display the prompt message: Cleaning failed. Cleaning mode is only available when the patient type is adult. 13.12 Assisting Venipuncture The user can use the NIBP cuff to cause a pressure close to diastolic pressure, so as to block the venous blood vessel and therefore help venipuncture. To assist venipuncture: 1. Select NIBP Setup > Venipuncture; 2. Select the appropriate Cuff Pressure according to the patient type; 3. Select Start, the monitor displays: Venipuncture Starting. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 4. Wait until the monitor prompts In venipuncture process. If an abnormal alarm occurs before it, no follow-up operation can be carried out. Restart the procedure after checking if necessary; 5. Puncture vein and draw blood sample; 6. Select Stop to deflate the cuff. If you do not deflate the cuff, the cuff automatically deflates when the venipuncture time expires (170 seconds for adult and pediatric patient, 85 seconds for neonatal patient). During venipuncture, pay attention to the cuff pressure and the countdown displayed in the NIBP numerics area. When the remaining time is 30 seconds, the monitor issues a reminder tone and the countdown displays in red, prompting the user that the venipuncture time is to expire. 1 Only when the monitor exits Venipuncture menu, the user can do other operations. 2 When the monitor is in DEMO mode, continuous measurement process, manual measurement process, sequence measurement process or auto measurement process, Assisting Venipuncture function is not available. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring TEMP Chapter 14 Monitoring TEMP 14.1 Overview Body temperature is measured by means of a thermistor probe (a semiconductor whose resistance changes with temperature) that is applied to the skin or to the rectum. Two TEMP probes can be used simultaneously to measure two TEMP values, and get the temperature difference. The standard configuration is skin probe for adult. Connector for TEMP probe 1 Connector for TEMP probe 2 14.2 TEMP Safety Information 1 Verify probe cables fault detection before the beginning of monitoring phase. Unplug the temperature probe cable of the channe1 from the socket, and then the screen will display the error message TEMP T1 Sensor Off and the audible alarm is activated. It is the same to the other channel. 2 Take the TEMP probe and cable carefully. When they are not in use, you should coil up the probe and cable into a loose circle. If the wire inside the cable is tensely pulled, it may cause mechanical damage to the probe and the cable. 3 Temperature probes do not need any probe covers; please remember to disinfect the probe after each use on a patient. 1 The reference body site temperature is the same as the temperature of the measuring site. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring TEMP 2 The cumulative use time for the oral or rectal temperature probe in a single patient should be less than 24 hours. 14.3 Selecting TEMP Sensor Type The user can choose the TEMP sensor type as the temperature signal source. To configure the TEMP sensor type, select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups, and set TEMP Sensor to YSI-10K or YSI-2.252K. 14.4 Switching T1/T2 On/Off In Menu > System Setup > Module Switch or select shortcut key ModuleSet > Module Switch, T1 or T2 can be switched on/off separately and won’t be affected by each other. 14.5 TEMP Monitoring Setup  With a reusable TEMP probe you can plug the probe directly into the TEMP connector on XM module.  Apply the TEMP probes securely to the patient.  Switch on the monitor It takes 5 minutes for the temperature measurement to stabilize. 14.6 Selecting a Temperature for Monitoring Select the temperature label according to the measurement site. The label is a unique identifier for each type of temperature. To select the label, 1. Click the TEMP parameter area to enter TEMP Setup menu. 2. Select the appropriate label from the list for T1 and T2. Label Description Tskin Skin temperature Trect Rectal temperature Tcore Core temperature Tcore is only available when TEMP Sensor is YSI-2.252K. 14.7 Calculating Temp Difference The monitor can calculate and display the difference between two temperature values by subtracting the second value from the first. The difference is labeled TD. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP Chapter 15 Monitoring IBP 15.1 Overview IBP is measured by means of a catheter inserted directly into the circulatory system. A pressure transducer connected to the catheter converts the mechanical force exerted by the blood into an electrical signal, which is displayed graphically as pressure versus time on a monitor screen or numerically on digital display. The monitor measures direct blood pressure of one selected blood vessel through a maximum of eight channels, and displays waveforms and pressure of measured direct blood pressure (SYS, DIA and MAP). Zero key for IBP IBP connector 15.2 IBP Safety Information 1 The operator should avoid contact with the conductive parts of the appurtenance when it is connected or applied. 2 When the monitor is used with HF surgical equipment, the transducer and the cables must be avoided from conductive connection to the HF equipment. This is to protect against burns to the patient. 3 Disposable IBP transducer or domes should not be reused. 4 If any kind of liquid, other than solution to be infused in pressure line or transducer, is splashed on the equipment or its accessories, or enters the transducer or the monitor, contact the Hospital Service Center immediately. 5 All invasive procedures have risks to the patient. Use aseptic technique and follow catheter manufacturer's instructions. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 6 Mechanical shock to the invasive blood pressure transducer may cause severe shifts in zero and calibration, and then cause erroneous readings. 7 The longest duration of IBP arterial catheterization is 7 days. 1 Use only the pressure transducer listed in the IBP Accessories. 2 If measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) on a sitting patient, adjust the transducer on the same level with the top of the patient’s ear. Incorrect leveling may lead incorrect 3 Confirm you set correct alarm limit for labels, the alarm limit you set are stored for its label only. Changing label may change the alarm limit. 4 Don’t perform IBP calibration when a patient is being monitored. 5 When using high frequency ventilation, make sure that the ventilator catheter is not connected to or indirectly connected to the arterial catheter at zero pressure. This can lead to less pressure variations, thus interfere the zeroing process. 15.3 Monitoring Procedures Preparatory steps for IBP measurement: 1. Plug the pressure cable into the IBP socket on XM module or V-IBP module and switch on the monitor. 2. Prepare the flush solution. 3. Flush through the system, exhaust all air from the tube, and ensure that the transducer and stopcocks are free of air bubbles. 4. Connect the patient catheter to the pressure line, making sure that there is no air present in the catheter or pressure line. 5. Position the transducer so that it is at the same level with the patient’s heart, approximately mid-axillary line. 6. For the label name selection, please refer to Selecting a Pressure for Monitoring. 7. To zero the transducer, please refer to Zeroing the Pressure Transducer. If there are air bubbles in the tube system, you should flush the system with the solution again. The bubbles may cause erroneous pressure readings. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.3.1 Selecting a Pressure for Monitoring Tell the monitor which pressure you want to monitor by selecting its pressure label. The label is a unique identifier for each type of pressure. When you choose a label, the monitor uses that label’s stored settings, for example color, wave scale and alarm settings. The label also determines which algorithm is used to process the pressure signal, so an incorrect label can lead to incorrect pressure values. To select the label, please refer to the following table: ART Arterial blood pressure PA Pulmonary artery pressure CVP Central venous pressure ICP Intracranial pressure LAP Left atrial pressure RAP Right atrial pressure P1-P2 Alternative non-specific pressure labels The pressure option is only valid when the label is P1/P2 and does not take effect under other labels. 15.3.2 Zeroing the Pressure Transducer To avoid inaccurate pressure readings, the monitor requires a valid zero. Zero the transducer in accordance with your hospital policy (at least once per day). You must perform a zero:  When you use a new transducer or tubing;  Every time you reconnect the transducer cable to the monitor;  If you think the monitor’s pressure readings are not correct. When using a pressure module, the zero information is stored in the module. The zeroing procedure is listed as below: 1. Turn off the stopcock to the patient. 2. Vent the transducer to atmospheric pressure, to compensate for the static and atmospheric pressure exerted on the transducer. 3. In the setup menu for the pressure, select Zero Channel: XX or Zero All. (XX stands for the IBP label name). After confirmation, the user can zero the pressure of certain channel or pressure of all channels. After zeroing, the interface displays the result and last calibration 4. When you see the message Zero Ok, please close the stopcock to atmospheric pressure, and open the stopcock to the patient. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.3.3 Troubleshooting the Pressure Zeroing (Taking Art for Example) The status message lists the probable cause of an unsuccessful calibration. Cause Corrective Action Art ZERO FAIL Make sure that the transducer is not attached to the patient. Art SENSOR OFF, FAIL Make sure that transducer is not off, and then proceed IN DEMO, FAIL Make sure that the monitor is not in DEMO mode. Contact service technician if necessary. PRESSURE OVER RANGE, Make sure that the stopcock is vented to atmosphere. If the FAIL problem persists, please contact service technician. PULSATILE PRESSURE Make sure that the transducer is vented to air, not connected ZERO FAIL to a patient, and try again. 15.3.4 IBP Calibration IBP is not user-calibrated. Calibration should be performed by a qualified service professional as frequently as dictated by your Hospital Procedures Policy. 15.4 Changing the IBP Waveform Ruler The top, middle and bottom rulers are available for each channel of IBP waveform. Users can adjust the top, middle or bottom rulers manually: 1. Open the menu Wave Setup of IBP by clicking on the IBP waveform area. 2. Select a suitable ruler from the options TopRuler, MidRuler and BotRuler. 15.5 IBP Waveform Overlapping The monitor can display IBP overlapped waveforms. To set IBP waveform overlapping: 1. Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups, and set IBP Wave Overlapping to On or Off. 2. Click the IBP waveform area to show the IBP Wave Setup menu. 3. Select Add IBP Waves and then select the IBP waves for overlapping from the pop-up list. A maximum of four overlapping waveforms can be displayed. 4. After exiting the interface, the main screen will display the overlapped IBP waves. The flashing label is the main label of the waveform area. Click the IBP overlapping waveform area on the main screen, and then select Setup Rulers. The user can select a suitable ruler for the overlapped waveforms from the options TopRuler and PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.6 Measuring PAWP PAWP, Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure, used to assess the cardiac function, is obtained by introducing a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery flotation catheter into the pulmonary artery. When the catheter is in one of the smaller pulmonary arteries, the inflated balloon occludes the artery allowing the monitor to record changes in the intrathoracic pressures that occur throughout the respiration cycle. The user can view the PAWP measurement result via connected MFM-CMS. 15.6.1 Measurement Procedures Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP) values are affected by fluid status, myocardial contractility, valve and pulmonary circulation integrity. The most accurate PAWP values are obtained at the end of the respiration cycle when the intrathoracic pressure is fairly constant. You can use the respiration waveform as a reference when assessing the PAWP waveform, to ensure constant measurement timing relative to the respiratory cycle. To start the measurement: 1. On the standard screen interface, select the PA parameter window to enter its setup menu. Then, select Setup > PAWP Activate to open the PAWP measurement window. 2. Prepare and check the accessories according to your hospital policy. 3. Wedge the flotation catheter into the pulmonary artery. Then inflate the balloon and pay attention to PA waveform changes on the screen. 4. After obtaining a stable PAWP waveform, press Freeze to freeze the waveform. In freeze status, you can adjust the PAWP scale to an appropriate position by selecting Measure and moving the cursors up and down according to the clinical experience. Select Confirm to store the PAWP, CVP, HR values. To review the frozen waveform, press Browse and rotate the rotary knob clockwise or counter-clockwise as desired. If you need to review the stored PAWP, CVP, HR values, select PAWP Review. 5. Deflate the balloon when the monitor prompts you “Please deflate the balloon!”. 6. If you need to start a new measurement, select Remeasure. 7. Click on Exit or select Setup > PAWP Exit to exit. 1 Prolonged inflation can cause pulmonary hemorrhage, infarction or both. Inflate the balloon for the minimum time necessary to get an accurate measurement. 2 If the PAWP (mean) is greater than the PA (systolic), deflate the balloon and report the incident in accordance with hospital policy, because the pulmonary artery could be accidently ruptured, and the PAWP value derived will not reflect the patient’s hemodynamic state, but will merely reflect the pressure in the catheter or balloon. 3 The pressure receiver in the catheter records the pressure change that occurs only at the front of the obstruction. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 4 Due to the short measurement delay, do not use sidestream CO as a direct reference to determine the end point of the breath in the pressure curve. 5 If the balloon is not inflated but the pulmonary artery floating catheter enters the wedge position, the pulmonary artery pressure waveform becomes wedge-shaped. Follow the standard steps to take appropriate action to correct this situation. 6 PAWP measurement is not applicable to pediatric and neonate patients. 15.7 Calculating CPP CPP is calculated by subtracting MAP and ICP, it means: CPP = MAP-ICP. 15.7.1 Calculation Procedures To calculate CPP: 1. Click the ICP parameter area to enter into ICP Options interface, select Setup to enter into ICP Setup > CPP Source; CPP source is defaulted as the currently opened artery, it can be selected as Art, P1 or P2. If there is more than one arterial pressure at the same time, the priority level should be: Art > P1 > P2. 2. Take P1 as example: if P1 is selected as CPP Source, when MAP and ICP are both measured, ICP area will display CPP and its value as below picture, unit is same as ICP. Invalid CPP will display “-?-”. CPP will be closed if exit ICP parameter. 15.8 Calculating PPV Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) is calculated from the specific arterial pressure values, which reflects the variation between the maximal pulse pressure and the minimum pulse pressure in 30 seconds. Pulse pressure is affected by left ventricular-stroke volume, arterial resistance and arterial compliance. 1 The clinical value of the derived PPV information must be determined by a physician. According to recent scientific literature, the PPV information is restricted to sedated patients who receive controlled mechanical ventilation and without arrhythmia. Whether the calculation results in other situations are clinically significant, applicable and reliable must be determined by a physician. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring IBP 2 In below situations, the calculated PPV value may be inaccurate: - the respiration rate is lower than 8 rpm - the tidal volume during ventilation is lower than 8 ml/kg - patients have acute right ventricular functional disorder (pulmonary heart disease) 3 PPV measurement has been validated only for adult patients. PPV is calculated according to the following equation: PPV= (PPmax – PPmin)/(PPmax + PPmin)/2) * 100% To select an arterial pressure as PPV source: 1. Click the PPV parameter area to enter PPV Setup menu. 2. Select Art, P1, P2, or AUTO as PPV Source. Only when P1 and P2 are arterial pressure can they be selected as PPV source. When it is set to AUTO and if there is more than one arterial pressure at the same time, the priority level should be: Art > P1 > P2. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring CO Chapter 16 Monitoring CO To patient Adult CO /Flow Sensor with CO Sensor Attached To ventilator To patient Pediatric CO /Flow Sensor with CO Sensor Attached To ventilator To patient Neonatal CO /Flow Sensor with CO Sensor Attached 1 The flow or CO /flow sensor type is detected when the sensor is connected to the RM module. The flow sensor type is communicated to the monitor. Flow sensors are uniquely identifiable based on connector design. 2 Adult, pediatric and neonatal flow or CO /flow sensor bodies are color-coded to assist the user in identifying that the correct type of flow sensor is being used. For more information on which sensor to use, refer to RM Accessories. 20.4 Zero Calibration The zero calibration is performed automatically during measurement. Also, a manual zero calibration can be started whenever major errors of measurements are detected or the numerical accuracy is in doubt. To manually zero the sensor, select Zero on the RM Setup menu to initiate a zero calibration. 20.5 Purging The RM module features an automatic and manual purge function which provides a flush of room air to keep the sensor tubing free from water condensation and patient secretions. 20.5.1 Automatic Purging An automatic purging is performed during measurement at the intervals varying with different types of sensors. In adult mode, the system purges the sensor tubing every 10 minutes, while in neonatal or pediatric mode; the purge cycle will be at every 3 minutes. 20.5.2 Manual Purging A manual purging may be required when water condensation is accumulated in the sensor tubing or the flow wave is abnormal. To perform a manual purging, select Purge on the RM Setup menu to initiate a purge cycle. 20.6 Gas Compensation The proportions of anesthetic gases in the airway will influence the flow measurement; thus, gas compensation is required for correcting the calculation. Gas compensation can be finished by using the manually entered gas concentrations. If the airway gas conditions are not properly set in the monitor, the measured flow will be incorrect. The measurement error is dependent on the airway gas conditions, flow rate and barometric pressure. The table below is an example of the magnitude of error to expect. The first line in the table is the baseline gas conditions at a flow rate of 40 L/min and a barometric pressure of 760 mmHg. Each of the successive lines in the table is the error to expect in the flow measurement with the specified gas condition if the airway gas conditions were improperly set to the baseline conditions in the first line.

PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ICG Chapter 21 Monitoring ICG* *not available in U.S.A. 21.1 Overview Impedance cardiography (ICG) monitoring provides hemodynamic parameters based on the measurement of thoracic electrical bio-impedance. With the V-ICG module, the monitor determines hemodynamic parameters as well as indexed versions of those parameters, through which you can assess a patient’s hemodynamic status and ventricular function. The user can view the ICG measurement result via connected CMS. Connector for ICG patient cable The V-ICG module and the ICG patient cable provide the monitor with an ICG waveform and the following numerics: – HR (heart rate) – SV (stroke volume) – SVRI (systemic vascular resistance index) – SI (stroke index) – C.O. (cardiac output) – TFC (thoracic fluid content) – SVR (systemic vascular resistance) – QI (quality indicator) – DO I (oxygen delivery index) – CI (cardiac index) PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ICG 21.2 Safety Information 1 Only connect one patient at the same time to the V-ICG module. 2 The sensors must not have a direct contact to other electrically conductive materials. 3 Because of hygienic reasons only disposable electrodes/sensors should be used. 4 Before monitoring patients with pacemakers, ensure that the function of the pacemaker cannot be influenced by the measuring current used for impedance cardiography. In the case of minute ventilation pacemakers the use of the V-ICG module and ICG patient cable is not allowed if the minute ventilation function of the pacemaker is activated. 5 The V-ICG module and ICG patient cable are not intended to be used while exposing the patient to high frequency current. 6 Handle the ICG patient cable and lead wires carefully and position them so that they do not cross over each other or other cables or power cords to avoid signal interference. 7 Do not expose the cables to mechanic or thermic impact. Avoid temperatures above 40 °C (100 °F). The ICG measurements are very sensitive measurements that measure very small signals. Technological limitations don't allow higher immunity levels than 1 V/m for radiated RF electromagnetic fields and 1 Vrms for conducted disturbances induced by RF fields. Electromagnetic fields with field strengths above 1 V/m and conducted disturbances above 1 Vrms may cause erroneous measurements. Therefore the manufacturer recommends that you avoid using electrically radiating equipment in the close proximity of these measurements. 21.3 ICG Patient Cable The patient cable for impedance cardiography contains a small box, which includes a cable splitter for the two branches (right and left): PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ICG On the outside of the box, two LEDs (green and orange) display the current function of the patient cable, as indicated below: Green Orange Description of function The electric part of the patient cable is not connected with the power supply; cable is disconnected or the device is switched off Patient cable is ready to use, but the measurement has not been started Measurement is running; sensor contact is good Bad contact between sensors and patient: at least one lead wire is disconnected or not properly fixed; sensors are too dry (eventually new sensors are necessary) Insufficient contact between sensors and patient: at least one lead wire is disconnected or not properly fixed; sensors are too dry (new sensors are necessary) Patient cable has power but the module is not ready for measurement Legend: LED off LED flashing LED on 21.4 Precautions and Limitations With the V-ICG module and the ICG patient cable, you can examine adult patients in a resting position. The measured parameters can be used only if the ICG waveform has sufficient signal quality and is without artifact. The method of impedance cardiography (ICG) is based on a theoretical model of blood flow PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring ICG movement in the thorax (aorta). If the physiological and clinical conditions of the patient are not in accordance with the assumptions of the model, inaccuracies in the parameters may occur. The following conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of ICG measurement:  Septic shock  Aortic valve regurgitation and defect of septum  Severe aortic sclerosis, aortic prosthesis  Severe hypertension (MAP > 130 mmHg)  Cardiac arrhythmia  Tachycardia with a heart rate higher than 200 bpm  Patient heights below 120 cm or above 230 cm  Patient weights less than 30 kg or greater than 155 kg  Patient movement  Aortic balloon or aortic balloon pump  Simultaneous use of electrical cautery systems during surgical procedures  During operation on the opened thorax the current distribution can be distorted and can lead to inaccuracies. 21.5 Starting a Measurement 21.5.1 Measurement Procedure 1.

The display on your monitor may be configured to look slightly different depending on the modules mounted. PM PRO-1 User Manual Basic Operation This menu displays the measurement modules which have been mounted in the XM module slot, three-slot module rack and PAM from top to bottom. Beside each measurement connector is the measurement label. The color in which a measurement connector appears matches the status of the measurement parameter. Colored: indicates the module is activated. Grey: indicates the module is deactivated. Colored with a “!” appearing: indicates a module conflict. For IBP connectors, with a circle-slash symbol appearing: indicates an IBP module For IBP connectors in the XM module: indicates this XM module is not configured with an IBP module. Colored: indicates the NMT module is activated. 3.3.2 Activating / Deactivating a Parameter Measurement For different measurement parameters, approaches to parameter activation / deactivation may vary a little. Take the parameters ECG and NIBP in XM module for example: PM PRO-1 User Manual Basic Operation  To activate / deactivate the ECG measurement, select the ECG connector in the XM module on the MeasureSet menu, and set the ECG measurement to on or off on the pop-up  To activate / deactivated the NIBP measurement, select the NIBP connector in the XM module on the MeasureSet menu, and the NIBP measurement will directly be activated / deactivated. 3.3.3 Resolving Module Conflicts This monitor supports a maximum of eight channels of IBP measurement. Both the XM module and each V-IBP module provide two channels of IBP measurement. A maximum of four V-IBP modules can be used simultaneously if the XM module is not used, while three if the XM module is used. If eight channels of IBP measurement are loaded, another IBP module’s plugging in will trigger an IBP module conflict; the corresponding IBP connector will be changed into on the MeasureSet menu as an indication. To remove the IBP conflict, unplug the conflicting module and re-plug it while less than eight channels of IBP are loaded. For other modules, only one of the same type is available at a time; another one inserted will be in the conflicting status. For example, if a CO module (module A) is loaded then another CO module (module B) is inserted, a symbol “!” in red will appear on the corresponding connector on the MeasureSet menu to indicate a module conflict. To use module B, directly select the connector of module B on the MeasureSet menu, and module A is consequently switched to be in conflicting status. Especially, for resolving a BIS module conflict, you also need to disconnect connection between the V-BIS module and the BISx device and reconnect the BISx device to the V-BIS module which you need to use. 3.3.4 Resolving IBP Label Conflicts Each label must be unique and can only be assigned once. The measurement labels are stored in the measurement modules. If you try to use two measurement modules that have identical labels, this causes a label conflict in the monitor. For example, an IBP module (module A) has already been loaded and the label Art is used for module A. Then another IBP module (module B) is inserted and the label Art is also used for module B. In this case, a label conflict will be triggered. A prompt indicating IBP label conflict will appear on the left of the screen. Additionally, at the corresponding measurements area, two labels flicker to indicate a label conflict. The label inside the brackets is the conflicting one while the label outside the brackets is the default one assigned by the system. Via comparing the labels displayed on the MeasureSet menu with the label outside the brackets, you may identify the model with a label conflict and accordingly decide on the module to work. The IBP module with a label conflict will not provide any measurement data; besides, the functions of setup, zeroing and calibrating are unavailable. To resolve the label conflict, you have to change the conflicting label into a non-conflicting one. Three resolutions are available: PM PRO-1 User Manual Basic Operation Resolution 1: 1 Select the IBP channel with a label conflict on the screen and open the Options menu. 2 Choose another label among the options from the Alias pull-down list to resolve the label Resolution 2: 1 Deactivate the parameter with label A which works properly or unplug the corresponding 2 The conflicting label A will consequently turn to be available.

It should be assured that the probe is used in the electromagnetic environment specified in this manual. For the monitoring procedures, please refer to Section Monitoring Steps for IRMA Module. 16.4 Setting CO Corrections Temperature, water vapor in the patient’s breath, barometric pressure, and the proportions of O , N O and Helium in the mixture all influence CO absorption. If values seem inaccurately high or low, check that the monitor is using the appropriate corrections. For the ELITECH sidestream module, the following items are available in the CO Other Setup menu: N O Compen., O Compens., Anest. Agent, Vapor Compen. and Pump Rate. The concentration of compensated gas should be set based on the current gas concentration which is supplied for patient. As for O and N O, Make the supplied gas concentration multiply to its volume to get the concentration. For instance, supply 100% O , and its volume is 60%, then O compensation is: 100%*60% = 60%. AG concentration is decided by anaesthesia apparatus. For the Respironics CO modules, there are Baro Press, O Compens, Anes Agent and Balance Gas in the CO Other Setup menu. The concentration of compensated gas (including O and AG) should be set based on the current gas concentration which is supplied for patient. The selection of balance gas depends on actual situation. For instance, N O should be selected as balance gas if the real balance gas is N O. For the Masimo CO modules, there are N O Compens and O Compens in the CO Other Setup menu. The N O Compens includes two options: low and high, default is Low. Low refers to N O concentration is 0~30%, and High refers to N O concentration is 30%~70%. O Compens includes three options: low, medium and high, default is Low. Low refers to O concentration is 0~30%, Medium refers to O concentration is 30%~70%, and High refers to O concentration is 70%~100%. After settings, the interface will display a dialog box: Confirm to change the settings? And the detailed settings are displayed under the warning. Click Yes to confirm, and click No to cancel the settings.

PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 18.2.3 Safety Information for Dräger Minimodule 1 Dräger Minimodule is intended to be used by trained and authorized health care professionals only. 2 Dräger Minimodule must not be used in areas where combustible or explosive gas mixtures are likely to occur. 3 Modifications to the module may lead to malfunctions. 4 It’s recommended to use accessories approved by Dräger. If other, incompatible accessories are used, there is a risk of patient injury due to module failure. 5 Do not use the module near magnetic resonance imagers (MRI, NMR, NMI). 6 During warm-up, reported values may not be accurate. 7 If the gas sensors are not ready for operation, the patient will not be adequately monitored. Before using the medical device, ensure a suitable substitute monitoring. 8 Misdiagnosis or misinterpretation of the measured values or other parameters can endanger the patient. Do not make therapeutic decisions based solely on individual measured values and monitoring parameters. Therapeutic decisions must be made solely by qualified users. 9 When using three anesthetic agents, the oxygen measurement may be inaccurate. Only use two agents at a time. 10 The use of authentic Dräger sample lines is strongly recommended, as other sample lines with an incorrect length and/or diameter may lead to erroneous agent concentration readings and waveforms or watertrap/sample line alarms. 11 Never use standard pressure-sensor tubing or IV lines (PVC) because it absorbs anesthetic agents, which are released later (degassing) resulting in erroneous agent concentration readings. 12 The sample flow diverted by the module may reduce the breathing system volume in case of low-flow anesthesia. Compensate either by increasing the fresh-gas flow of the anesthesia machine accordingly or by returning the sample gas to the breathing system. In some anesthesia systems, the sample flow may influence the measurement of the expiratory minute volume. 13 The liquid in the watertrap could be contaminated and must be handled and disposed of with care. Dispose of the liquid in an adequate way and in compliance with local regulations. 14 Disconnect sample line before removing the watertrap from the medical device. Contaminated liquid could be pushed out of the watertrap when removing it without disconnecting the sample line. 15 Connect the sample line properly; otherwise faulty gas measurements may result.

Wait until the monitor’s warm-up message disappears; keep the monitor away from AG 2. In the AG Setup menu, set Work Mode to Measure. 3. Select Zero Calibration in AG Setup menu. 18.3.1.2 Measurement Steps 1. Fix the water trap to the water trap holder in the V-AG module (ELITECH AG module), confirm it is well fixed. 2. Connect the sampling cannula or the sampling line to the water trap. 3. Set Work Mode to Measure. 4. For intubated patients, an airway adapter is required. For non-intubated patients, place the nasal cannula or the sampling mask onto the patient. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 1 The water trap collects water drops condensed in the sampling line and therefore prevents them from entering the module. If the water trap is nearly filled, you should replace it to avoid blocking the airway. 2 When replacing the water trap or suspecting the measurement value, please check if the O-rings of the water trap holder are normal and well installed. If the O-rings get damaged or loose, contact the manufacturer’s service staff. 3 To prevent the module from abnormal work, please ensure the water trap detection button is not mistakenly touched. 4 Based on a sample gas temperature of 37 C, a room temperature of 23 C and sample relative humidity of 100%, the water trap will be filled after approximately 60 hours with the flowrate of 150 ml/min. In clinical practice, the water trap can be used for a longer time before it is filled. It is recommended to replace the water trap once every month. 5 Please replace and discard the water trap when blocking. Don’t reuse it, otherwise the reading is not accurate and even the device may be damaged. To avoid patient cross infection, do not connect the exhaust tube to the ventilator circuit. If the sampled gas is returned to the breathing system, always use the bacterial filter of the sample gas return kit. 18.3.1.3 MAC Calculation The MAC value is calculated and displayed by using end-tidal (Et) gas concentrations according to the following formula: EtAA1 is the concentration of the main anesthetic gas at the end of the breath. EtAA2 is the concentration of the secondary anesthetic gas at the end of the breath. EtN O is N O concentration at the end of the breath. MACstandard1 is the MACstandard value of the main anesthetic gas. MACstandard2 is the MACstandard value of the secondary anesthetic gas. MACstandardN O is the MACstandard value of N O. MACstandard value is as following: MACstandard PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 18.3.2 Monitoring Steps for Masimo ISA Module NomoLine Sampling Lines Masimo Sidestream CO module samples gas from the respiratory circuit through the NomoLine Family sampling line at a rate of 50 sml/min, making measurements of CO possible for adult, pediatric, infant and neonatal patients. The NomoLine Family of sampling lines are designed for optimal performance and measurement fidelity when used with the Masimo sidestream CO NomoLine sampling lines include nasal and nasal/oral cannulas for non-intubated patients with and without supplementary oxygen delivery and airway adapter sets for intubated patients. As long as no sampling line is connected, the Masimo Sidestream CO module remains in a low- power sleep mode. Once the sampling line is connected, the Masimo Sidestream CO module switches to measuring mode and starts delivering gas data. For ordering information about NomoLine sampling lines, cannulas, and related consumables, visit www.masimo.com. Working Status of ISA analyzer Working status of the ISA analyzer can be indicated by the indicator. For the detailed information, please refer to the following table.

Connect the sampling line to the ISA gas inlet connector (LEGI). 2. Check that the LEGI shows a steady green light (indicating that the system is OK). 3. For ISA OR+ and ISA AX+ module with O option fitted: Check that the O reading on the monitor is correct (21%). 4. Breathe into the sampling line and check that valid CO waveforms and values are displayed on the monitor. 5. Occlude the sampling line with a fingertip and wait for 10 seconds. 6. Check that an occlusion alarm is displayed and that the LEGI shows a flashing red light. 7. If applicable: Perform a tightness check of the patient circuit with the sampling line attached. 18.3.2.2 Leakage Check 1. Connect a new Nomoline sampling line with male luer lock to the ISA LEGI and check that the LEGI shows a steady green light. 2. Connect a short silicon tubing with an inner diameter of 3/32” (2.4 mm) to the Nomoline male luer. 3. Exhale a long breath into the silicon tubing until the CO concentration is greater than 4.5 vol% or 34 mmHg. 4. Quickly connect the silicon tubing tightly to the exhaust port. 5. Wait 1 minute until the CO concentration has stabilized. Note the value. 6. Wait 1 minute and check that the CO concentration has not decreased more than 0.4 vol% or 3 mmHg. If it has decreased more there is a major leakage in the ISA unit or in the Nomoline. Do not operate the ISA if there is a major leakage in the unit. 18.3.2.3 System Setup for Analyzer If your system is using the plug-in and measure ISA analyzer, please follow the setup instructions 1.

Perform a pre-use check as described in section Perform a pre-use Check. 18.3.2.4 Zeroing The infrared module needs to establish a zero reference level for the CO , N O and anesthetic agent gas measurement. This zero calibration is here referred to as \"zeroing\". PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG ISA analyzer performs zeroing automatically by switching the gas sampling from the respiratory circuit to ambient air. The automatic zeroing is performed every 24 hours, and takes less than 10 seconds for ISA analyzer. If the ISA analyzer is fitted with an oxygen sensor, the automatic zeroing will also include room air calibration of the oxygen sensor. Since a successful zeroing requires the presence of ambient air (21% O and 0% CO ), ensure that the ISA analyzer is placed in a well-ventilated place. Avoid breathing near the ISA analyzer before or during the zeroing procedure. 34.1 Inspecting The overall check of the monitor, including the safety check, should be performed only by qualified personnel every 24 months, and each time after fix up.

To prevent cleaning liquids and dust from entering the ISA gas analyzer through its LEGI connector, keep the Nomoline Family sampling line connected while cleaning the analyzer. Never immerse the ISA sidestream gas analyzer in liquid. 18.3.2.6 Maintenance Once every year, or whenever gas readings are questionable, perform a leakage check according to Section Leakage Check and verify gas readings with a reference instrument or with calibration The Nomoline sampling lines are non-sterile devices. To avoid damage, do not autoclave any parts of the sampling line. 18.3.2.7 Replacement of Consumables The Nomoline and Nomoline Airway Adapter Set are single-patient use products. The Nomoline Adapter is a multiple-patient use product. The T-adapter and Nomo Extension are single-patient use products. Nomoline Family sampling lines and all consumables mentioned above should be replaced according to good clinical practice or when the sampling line gets occluded. Occlusion occurs when water, secretion etc. is aspired from the respiratory circuit to such extent that ISA cannot maintain the normal 50 ml/min sample flow. This situation is indicated by a red flashing gas inlet connector and an alarm message; Replace the Nomoline and wait until the gas inlet connector switches to green indicating that the ISA gas analyzer is ready for use. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 18.3.2.8 MAC Calculation The MAC value is calculated and displayed by using end-tidal (Et) gas concentrations according to the following formula: %Et( AA1) %Et( AA2) %Et(N O) MAC  + + 2 X ( AA1) X ( AA2) 100 X (AA): HAL=0.75%, ENF=1.7%, ISO=1.15%, SEV=2.05%, DES=6.0% Altitude, patient age and other individual factors are not considered in the formula above. 18.3.3 Monitoring Steps for Dräger Minimodule 1. Fix the water trap to the water trap holder in the V-AG module (Dräger Minimodule ). 2. Connect the sampling cannula or the sampling line to the water trap. 3. Set Work Mode to Measure. 4. For intubated patients, an airway adapter is required. For non-intubated patients, place the nasal cannula or the sampling mask onto the patient. Upon start-up, the module passes through an initialization (status message MultiGas Initialization appears) and warm-up period (status message MultiGas Warming Up appears). During this time, concentrations for certain gases may not be available and the anesthetic agent may not be identified. After the warm-up period, the module will have achieved full ISO-accuracy. 18.3.3.1 Zeroing The module purges and zeroes itself and does not need any interaction by the user. Waveforms flatline and parameter box values blank from the screen during this cycle. 18.3.3.2 MAC Calculation Standard MAC values 1 standard MAC is equal to the alveolar anesthetic concentration at one atmosphere (760 mmHg) at which 50% of all patients no longer respond to noxious stimuli. The integrated MAC algorithm is based on the MAC values shown in the following table. The values specified in the table apply to a patient age of 40 years and are guiding values only. For gas mixtures, the respective multiples for N O and anesthetic agents are added according to the following equation. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG MAC  exp. conc. Anesth. 1  exp. conc.

An aged-based MAC of 1 year is used if the patient’s age is < 1 year. 3 If patient age is not entered, the default age-based MAC of 40 years is used. 18.3.4 Monitoring Steps for Masimo IRMA Module 1. Plug the IRMA connector into the IRMA input and switch the power on. 2. Snap the IRMA sensor head on the top of the IRMA airway adapter. It will click into place when properly seated. 3. A green LED indicates that the IRMA probe is ready for use. 4. Connect IRMA /airway adapter 15 mm male connector to the breathing circuit Y-piece. 5. Connect the IRMA /airway adapter 15 mm female connector to the patient’s endotracheal PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG Alternatively, connect an HME (Heat Moisture Exchanger) between the patient’s endotracheal tube and the IRMA probe. Placing an HME in front of the IRMA probe protects the airway adapter from secretions and effects of water vapor and eliminates the need of changing the adapter. It allows free positioning of the IRMA probe as well. 6. Unless the IRMA probe is protected with an HME always position the IRMA probe with the status LED pointing upwards. Working Status of IRMA Module The working status of the IRMA module can be transmitted by the IRMA probe. For the detailed information, please refer to the following table. Indication Status Steady green light System OK Blinking green light Zeroing in progress Steady blue light Anesthetic agent present Steady red light Sensor error Blinking red light Check adapter Remark: the blue light is applicable to IRMA AX+ only. 18.3.4.1 Placement of IRMA Probe When connecting IRMA probe to an infant patient circuit, it is important to avoid a direct contact between the IRMA probe and the infant’s body. If, for whatever the reason, the IRMA probe is in direct contact with any parts of the infant’s body, an insulation material shall be placed between the IRMA probe and the body. The IRMA probe is not intended to be in long term skin contact. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 18.3.4.2 Performing a Pre-use Check Prior to connecting the IRMA airway adapter to the breathing circuit, verify gas readings and waveforms on the monitor before connecting the airway adapter to the patient circuit. Perform the tightness check of the patient circuit with the IRMA probe snapped on the IRMA airway adapter. 18.3.4.3 Zeroing Incorrect probe zeroing will result in false gas readings. In order to secure high precision of the IRMA probe measurements the following zeroing recommendations should be followed. Zeroing is performed by snapping a new IRMA airway adapter onto the IRMA probe, without connecting the airway adapter to the patient circuit, and then using the host instrument to transmit a zero reference command to the IRMA probe. Special care should be taken to avoid breathing near the airway adapter before or during the zeroing procedure. The presence of ambient air (21% O and 0% CO ) in the IRMA airway adapter is of crucial importance for a successful zeroing. If a “Zero Required” alarm appears directly after a zeroing procedure, the procedure has to be repeated. Always perform a pre-use check after zeroing the probe. Zeroing for IRMA AX+ probes: Zeroing should be performed every time the IRMA airway adapter is replaced, or whenever an offset in gas values or an unspecified gas accuracy message is displayed. Allow 30 seconds for warm up of the IRMA AX+ probes after power on and after changing the IRMA airway adapter before proceeding with the Zeroing Procedure. The green LED on the probe will be blinking for approximately 5 seconds while zeroing is in progress. 18.3.4.4 Cleaning The IRMA probe can be cleaned using a cloth moistened with maximum 70% ethanol or maximum 70% isopropyl alcohol. Remove the disposable IRMA airway adapter prior to cleaning the IRMA probe. 1 The IRMA airway adapters are non-sterile devices. Do not autoclave the devices as this will damage them. 2 Never immerse the IRMA probe in liquid. 18.3.4.5 Maintenance Gas readings should be verified at regular intervals with a reference instrument or by conducting the gas check. The suggested interval is once every year. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG 18.3.4.6 MAC Calculation The MAC value is calculated and displayed by using end-tidal (ET) gas concentrations according to the following formula: MAC=%ET (AA )/X (AA )+%ET(AA )/X (AA )+%ET (N O)/100 X (AA): HAL=0.75%, ENF=1.7%, ISO=1.15%, SEV=2.05%, DES=6.0% 18.4 Setting Apnea Alarm Time This determines the time limit after which the monitor gives an alarm if the patient stops breathing. 1 Select the CO (AG) Setup > Apnea Alm; 2 Choose the apnea alarm time from the pull-down list. 18.5 O Compensations The following models need O compensation: IRMA AX+, ISA AX+, G7+ and G7S+. For the compensation details, please refer to the following. For the Masimo AG modules, the following table is for your reference: O Range Set O Range 0 to 30 vol% Low 30 to 70 vol% Med. 70 to 100 vol% High For G7 module, the following items are available in the AG Other Setup menu: O Compens. and Vapor Compen.. The concentration of compensated gas should be set based on the current gas concentration which is supplied for patient. As for O , Make the supplied gas concentration multiply to its volume to get the concentration. For instance, supply 100% O , and its volume is 60%, then O compensation is: 100%*60% = 60%. AG concentration is decided by anaesthesia apparatus. For G7 with O module, the O compensation is automatic; for G7 without O module, the O compensation is manual. After settings, the interface will display a dialog box: Confirm to change the settings? And the detailed settings are displayed under the warning. Click Yes to confirm, and click No to cancel the settings. 18.6 Effects of Humidity The partial pressure and the volume percentage of CO , N O, O and anesthetic agents depend on the amount of water vapor in the measured gas. The O measurement will be calibrated to show 20.8 vol% at actual ambient temperature and humidity level, instead of showing actual partial pressure. 20.8 vol% O corresponds to the actual O concentration in room air with 0.7 vol% H O concentration (at 1013 hPa this equals for example 25 °C an d 23% RH). The measurement of CO , N O, and anesthetic agents (e.g. all gases measured by the IR-bench) will always show the actual partial pressure at the current humidity level. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring AG In the alveoli of the patient, the breathing gas is saturated with water vapor at body temperature When the breathing gas flows through the sampling line, the gas temperature will adapt to ambient before reaching the gas analyzer. As the NOMO section removes all condensed water, no water will reach the ISA gas analyzer. The relative humidity of the sampled gas will be about 95%. If CO values at BTPS are required, the following equation can be used: EtCO = EtCO value sent from ISA [vol %] Pamb = Ambient pressure sent from ISA [kPa] 3.8 = Typical partial pressure of water vapor condensed between patient circuit and ISA [kPa] EtCO (BTPS) = EtCO gas concentration at BTPS [vol%] O is assumed to be room air calibrated at a humidity level of 0.7 vol% H O. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS Chapter 19 Monitoring BIS* *not available in U.S.A. 19.1 Overview Bispectral Index monitoring helps to monitor the hypnotic state of the brain based on acquisition and processing of EEG signals. The monitor processes raw EEG signals to produce a single number, namely BIS, which correlates with the patient's level of hypnosis. The user can view the BIS measurement result via connected MFM-CMS. Sensor check key Connector for BIS adapted cable The V-BIS module and BISx device provide the monitor with the display consisting of:  BIS EEG waveform  BIS trend  Measure values of BIS, SQI, SR, SEF, TP and BC - BIS: The BIS numeric reflects the patient’s level of consciousness. It ranges from 100 (fully awake) to 0 (absence of electrical brain activity). The BIS range guidelines are illustrated in the following chart. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS BIS Range and Clinical State  Responds to normal voice Light/ Moderate Sedation  May respond to loud commands or mild prodding/shaking e General Anesthesia n 60  Low probability of explicit recall R  Unresponsive to verbal stimulus n 40 Deep Hypnotic State 20  Burst Suppression 0 Flat Line EEG Note: This chart reflects a general association between clinical state and BIS values. Ranges are based on results from a multi-center study of the BIS involving the administration of specific anesthetic agents. BIS values and ranges assume that the EEG is free of artifacts that can affect its performance. Titration of anesthetics to BIS range should be dependent upon the individual goals established for each patient. These goals and associated BIS ranges may vary over time and in the context of patient status and treatment plan. - SQI: The SQI numeric reflects the signal quality for the EEG channel source and provides information about the reliability of the BIS, SR, SEF, TP and BC numerics during the last minute. It ranges from 0% to 100%: 0% to15%: the numerics cannot be derived. 15% to 50%: the numerics cannot be reliably derived. 50% to 100%: the numerics are reliable. - SR: The SR is the percentage of time over the last 63-second period that the signal is considered to be in the suppressed state. - SEF: The SEF is a frequency below which 95% of the total power is measured. - TP: The TP numeric indicates the power in the frequency band 0.5 Hz to 30 Hz. The useful range is 40 dB to 100 dB. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS - BC: (BISx device used with Extend Sensor only) The BC numeric helps to quantify suppression, reported as the number of EEG bursts per minute, where an EEG burst is defined as a period of activity followed and preceded by inactivity (at least 0.5 second). The BC numeric is valid when SQI ≥ 15% and SR ≥ 5%.  EMG bar graph: The EMG bar graph displays the power (in decibels) in the frequency range 70 Hz -110 Hz. This frequency range contains power from muscle activity (i.e., electromyography or “EMG”) as well as power from other high-frequency artifacts. When the indicator is low, it indicates that EMG activity is low. BIS monitoring conditions are optimal when the bar is empty. 1 bar represents power in the 30-34 range. 2 bars represent power in the 35-39 range. 3 bars represent power in the 40-44 range. 4 bars represent power in the 45-49 range. 5 bars represent power in the 50-54 range. 6 bars represent power in the 55-59 range. 7 bars represent power in the 60-64 range. 8 bars represent power in the 65-69 range. 9 bars represent power in the 70-74 range. 10 bars represent power greater than 74. 19.2 Safety Information 1 Explosion hazard: Do not use the BISx device in a flammable atmosphere or where concentrations of flammable anesthetics may occur. 2 The BISx device is not designed for use in MRI environment. 3 The use of accessory equipment not complying with the equivalent safety requirements of this equipment may lead to a reduced level of safety of the resulting system. Consideration relating to the choice shall include: use of the accessory in the patient vicinity; evidence that the safety certification of the accessory has been performed in accordance to the appropriate IEC 60601-1 harmonized national 4 Due to elevated surface temperature, do not place the BISx device in prolonged direct contact with patient’s skin, as it may cause discomfort. 5 To reduce the hazard of burns during use of high- frequency surgical equipment, the sensor or electrodes should not be located between the surgical site and the electro- surgical unit return electrode. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS 6 The conductive parts of electrodes or sensor and connectors should not contact other conductive parts, including earth. 7 To reduce the hazard of burns during use of brain-stimulating devices (e.g., transcranial electrical motor evoked potential), place stimulating electrodes as far as possible from the BIS sensor and make certain that sensor is placed according to package instructions. 8 The sensor must not be located between defibrillator pads when a defibrillator is used on a patient connected to the BISx device. 9 To minimize the risk of patient strangulation, the patient interface cable (PIC) must be carefully placed and secured. 10 Universal precautions shall be observed to prevent contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Place contaminated materials in regulated waste container. 11 Whenever an event such as spillage of blood or solutions occurs, re-test ground leakage current before further use. 12 Do not reuse the BIS sensor. 1 Do not autoclave the BISx device. Autoclaving will seriously damage the components. 2 Do not open the BISx device for any reason. 3 The BISx device has been designed to operate with a BIS sensor. The sensor is a silver/silver chloride electrode array that utilizes Aspect's patented Zipprep™ technology and uses a proprietary connector. Use of other electrodes is not recommended. 4 Considerations when using Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT) equipment during BIS monitoring: Place ECT electrodes as far as possible from the BIS sensor to minimize the effect of interference. Certain ECT equipment may interfere with the proper function of the BISx device. Check for compatibility of equipment during patient 5 Avoid liquid ingress to the Patient Interface Cable. Contact of fluids with the PIC sensor connector can interfere with PIC performance. 6 When connecting or disconnecting the BISx device, take care not to touch the exposed contacts of either connector. Damage due to electrostatic discharge may PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS 7 Using accessories other than those specified may result in increased electromagnetic emissions or decreased electromagnetic immunity of the BISx 8 The BISx device should not be used adjacent to or stacked with other equipment. If adjacent or stacked use is necessary, the BISx device should be observed to verify normal operation in the configuration in which it will be used. 19.3 BIS Monitoring Setup Patient interface cable (PIC) V-BIS module BISx device Adapter cable BIS sensor 1. Connect the BISx device to the V-BIS module with the adapter cable and plug the V-BIS module into the monitor. 2. Using the attachment clip, secure the BISx device to a convenient location near the patient's 3. Prepare sensor site and place the BIS sensor on the patient in accordance with the instructions included on the sensor packaging. Make sure that the patient’s skin is dry. Be aware that a wet sensor or a salt bridge may cause erroneous BIS and impedance values. 4. Attach the BIS sensor to the PIC. To insert the sensor into the PIC, line up as shown and insert the sensor tab into the PIC sensor connector until an audible “click” is heard. The blank side of the sensor tab (i.e. the side without the computer chip) should be facing up. 1 Ensure that the BISx device does not come into prolonged contact with your patient’s skin, as it may generate heat and cause discomfort. 2 The BISx device may remain connected to a patient during defibrillation as long as the sensor is not located between the defibrillator pads. PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring BIS After you switch the operating mode of the monitor into monitoring mode from demo mode, you need to re-plug the V-BIS module into the monitor before starting BIS measurement. 19.4 BIS Continuous Impedance Check The continuous impedance check is always active to enable you to understand the sensor condition in real time. It checks:  The combined impedance of the signal electrodes and the reference electrode This is done continuously and does not affect the EEG wave. As long as the impedances are within the valid range, no prompt message of this check or its results will be announced  The impedance of the ground electrode This is done every ten minutes and takes approximately four seconds. It causes an artifact in the EEG wave, and the monitor will announce BIS Ground Check on the screen during the check. If the ground electrode does not pass the check, another check will be performed. This continues until the ground electrode passes the check. 19.5 BIS Sensor Check This measures the exact impedance of each individual electrode. It causes a disturbed EEG wave. 19.5.1 Starting a Sensor Check The sensor check is automatically started when a sensor is connected. To manually start a sensor  press the hard key on the V-BIS module, or  select BIS Setup > Sensor States and click Start Sensor Check. 19.5.2 Stopping a Sensor Check The sensor check stops automatically if the impedances of all electrodes are within the valid range. To manually stop a sensor check:  press the hard key on the V-BIS module, or  select BIS Setup > Sensor States and click Stop Sensor Check. 19.6 BIS Sensor Window To open the BIS sensor window, select Sensor States on the BIS Setup menu. The window may look slightly different on your monitor. The graphic in the BIS sensor window automatically adapts to show the type of sensor in use. Each symbol in the graphic represents an electrode and illustrates the most recently-measured impedance status of the electrodes. Although BIS may still be measured when the electrode is in Noise or High status, for best performance, all electrodes should be in Pass status.

PM PRO-1 User Manual Monitoring RM Chapter 20 Monitoring RM* *not available in U.S.A. 20.1 Overview The monitor measures respiratory mechanics by connecting the RM module with the flow sensor to produce numeric and waveforms for flow, volume and pressure of respiratory gases in the airway. The user can view the RM measurement result via connected CMS. Connector for CO Flow input receptacle The measurement provides:  Airway pressure (Paw), airway flow (Flow) and airway volume (Vol) waveforms.  Numerics for: – PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) – Pplat (plateau pressure) – PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure) – Pmean (mean airway pressure) – PIF (peak inspiratory flow) – PEF (peak expiratory flow) – TVi (inspiratory tidal volume) – TVe (expiratory tidal volume) – MVi (inspiratory minute volume) – MVe (expiratory minute volume) – I:E (ratio of the inspiratory time and expiratory time) – Cdyn (dynamic compliance) – Cstatic (static compliance) – RAWi (airway resistance-inspired) – RAWe (airway resistance-expired) – NIP (negative inspiratory pressure) – RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) – P (airway pressure at 100 msec after the start of inspiration) – AwRR (airway respiration rate) – EtCO (end-tidal carbon dioxide – FiCO (fraction of inspired carbon dioxide) Also, the measurement provides F-V (flow-volume) loops and P-V (pressure-volume) loops. For detailed information about loops, refer to Respiratory Loops. 20.2 Safety Information 1 EXPLOSION HAZARD - Do not use the RM module in the presence of flammable anesthetics or other flammable gasses when mixed with air, oxygen, or nitrous oxide. Use of the RM module in such environment may present an explosion hazard. 2 Follow precautions for electrostatic discharge (ESD) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) to and from other equipment. 3 If the RM module fails to respond as described in this manual, do not use it until approved for use by qualified personnel. 4 Do not position the sensor cables or tubing in any manner that may cause entanglement or strangulation. 5 Do not apply excessive tension to any cable or pneumatic tubing. 6 ELECTRICAL SHOCK HAZARD - The RM module contains no user serviceable parts. Refer servicing to qualified personnel. 7 Reuse (disassembly, cleaning, disinfecting, sterilizing, etc.) of the single patient use flow and CO /flow sensors may compromise device functionality and system performance and cause a potential patient hazard. Performance is not guaranteed if a sensor is reused. 8 Inspect the flow and CO /flow sensors prior to use and periodically during use. Do not use them if they appear to be damaged or broken. 9 Do not attempt to rotate a sensor in the breathing circuit by grasping the pneumatic tubes exiting the flow sensor. 10 Periodically inspect sensor tubing for kinks. 11 Replace the flow or CO /flow sensor if excessive moisture or secretions are observed in the pressure line tubing. 12 The RM module automatically identifies the type of sensor (adult, pediatric or neonatal) when it is connected. If the module does not identify the sensor when a sensor is first connected, do not use the sensor. If the condition persists, refer the module to qualified service personnel. 13 The use of the RM module is restricted to one patient at a time. Do not connect the sensors to multiple patients simultaneously. 14 The flow or CO /flow sensor connector should be properly inserted into the host receptacle prior to connecting a sensor to the breathing circuit, in order to avoid a circuit leak, or occlusion of sensor tubing. 15 Periodically check sensors and tubing for excessive moisture or secretion build up. 16 Although the RM module automatically purges the lines, moisture or secretions may still remain. 17 While using the sensors, a system leak, such as that caused by uncuffed endotracheal tubes or a damaged sensor may significantly affect flow related readings. These include flow, volume, pressure, dead space, CO production and other respiratory mechanics parameters. 18 The use of portable and mobile radio frequency (RF) communications equipment can affect this and other pieces of medical equipment. 19 The use of accessories, sensors and cables other than those specified by the manufacturer may increase emissions or decrease immunity of the equipment. 20 The patient sensors must not be located between defibrillator pads when a defibrillator is used on a patient. 21 To reduce the hazard of burns in the high-frequency surgical neutral electrode connection, the patient sensors should not be located between the surgical site and the electro-surgical unit return electrode. 22 The RM module is not intended to be used as an apnea monitor. 1 Always inspect the flow or CO /flow sensor set-up in ventilator prior to use. Insure that the patient flow connector is positively latched prior to use. 2 Always verify that the flow or CO /flow sensor type is correctly identified by the system prior to use. 3 Do not use the module if it appears to be damaged. 4 Always remove the flow or CO /flow sensor from the patient circuit before disconnecting the sensor from the module. 5 Do not use the RM module if it fails to operate properly, appears to have been damaged, is wet or has exterior condensation. 6 Do not clean the RM module and accessories except as directed in this manual. 7 Use only approved sensors and accessories with the RM module. 8 Do not spray cleaning agents directly into the flow sensor receptacles. 9 Never sterilize or immerse the module in liquids. 10 Do not sterilize or immerse sensors except as directed in this manual. 11 To avoid the effects of excessive moisture in the measurement circuit, insert the flow or CO /flow sensor in the ventilator circuit with the tubes upright. Improper placement may result in erroneous data. 12 Excessive moisture in the flow or CO /flow sensor tubing may affect the accuracy of the measurements. 13 It is recommended that the CO /flow sensors be removed from the circuit whenever an aerosolized medication is delivered. These medications may contaminate the sensor windows, causing the sensor to fail prematurely. 14 The use of some aerosolized medications may affect the accuracy of the flow only 15 Sudden erratic changes in the CO and pressure waveforms that do not correlate to the physiological condition of the patient may be signs that the module is experiencing electromagnetic interference. 16 The RM module complies with IEC 60601-1-2:2001, providing reasonable protection against electromagnetic interference in a typical medical installation. The equipment generates, uses and can radiate electromagnetic interference (EMI), and if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause interference with other devices in the vicinity. 17 If interference does occur, correct it using one or more of the following measures: – Move the receiving device or increase separation between the equipment. – Consult the manufacturer or members of the hospital’s engineering department for more information. 18 The RM module is not intended for use in a hyperbaric chamber or an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) environment. 1 Set the gas compensation on module startup, and whenever the nominal gas composition delivered to the patient is changed. 2 This product and its accessories which have patient contact are free of latex. 3 The following factors can influence CO and flow measurement: nitrous oxide, barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, airway pressure, O , helium and anesthetic agents. 20.3 Sensor Setup 1. Select the appropriate flow or CO /flow sensor in accordance with patient category. 2. If you are using a combined CO /flow sensor, connect it to the CO sensor first. Snap the airway adapter until it clicks into place. 3. Before connecting the flow or CO /flow sensor to the breathing circuit, insert its connector into the receptacle on the RM module. 4. Position the flow or CO /flow sensor into the breathing circuit between the wye and the elbow.

Replacement shall be taken if there is any evident defect or signs of aging which may impair the safety or performance. 3 Medical technical equipment such as these monitor/monitoring system must only be used by persons who have received adequate training in the use of such equipment and who are capable of applying it properly. 4 SHOCK HAZARD-To avoid the RISK of electric shock, this equipment must only be connected to a SUPPLY MAINS with protective earth. 5 EXPLOSION HAZARD-Do not use the device in a flammable atmosphere where concentrations of flammable anesthetics or other materials may occur. PM PRO-1 User Manual Intended Use and Safety Guidance 6 The simultaneous use of cardiac pacemaker and other patient-connected equipment may cause safety hazard. 7 The equipment can provide protective means to prevent the patient from being burned when used with HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. The equipment can protect against the effects of the discharge of a defibrillator. Use only accessories approved by the manufacturer. 8 Do not come into contact with the patient, table, or the monitor during defibrillation. 9 Extreme care must be exercised when applying medical electrical equipment. Many parts of the human/machine circuit are conductive, such as the patient, connectors, electrodes, transducers. It is very important that these conductive parts do not come into contact with other grounded, conductive parts when connected to the isolated patient input of the device. Such contact would bridge the patient's isolation and cancel the protection provided by the isolated input. In particular, there must be no contact of the neutral electrode and ground. 10 Magnetic and electrical fields are capable of interfering with the proper performance of the device. For this reason make sure that all external devices operated in the vicinity of the monitor comply with the relevant EMC requirements. X-ray equipment or MRI devices are a possible source of interference as they may emit higher levels of electromagnetic radiation. 11 Route all cables carefully to avoid possible entanglement, apnea, or electrical interference. For the device mounted over the patient, sufficient precautionary measures should be taken to prevent it from falling on the patient. 12 Devices connecting with monitor should be equipotential. 13 If the protective grounding (protective earth) system is doubtful, the monitor must be supplied by internal power only. 14 Two batteries must be used when the monitor uses internal power supply. 15 Accessory equipment connected to the analog and digital interfaces must be certified according to the respective IEC/EN standards. Furthermore all configurations shall comply with the valid version of the standard IEC/EN 60601-1. Therefore anybody, who connects additional equipment to the signal input or output connector to configure a medical system, must make sure that it complies with the requirements of the valid version of the system standard IEC/EN60601-1. If in doubt, consult our technical service department or your local distributor. 16 Only use patient cable and other accessories supplied by the manufacturer. The performance and electric shock protection cannot be guaranteed, and the patient may be injured otherwise. Prior to use, check if the casing of a disposable or sterilized accessory is intact. Do not use it if its casing is damaged. 17 Only recommended batteries can be used for the monitor. 18 The monitor is equipped with Wi-Fi to receive RF electromagnetic energy. Therefore, any other equipment complying with CISPR radiation requirements may also interfere with the wireless communication and make it interrupted. 19 Do not rely exclusively on the audible alarm system for patient monitoring. Adjustment of alarm volume to a low level or off during patient monitoring may result in a hazard to the patient. Remember that the most reliable method of patient monitoring combines close personal surveillance with correct operation of monitoring equipment. 20 Wireless LAN equipment contains an intentional RF radiator that has the potential of interfering with other medical equipment, including patient implanted devices. Be sure to perform the electromagnetic compatibility test, before installation and any time new medical equipment is added to the Wireless LAN coverage area. 21 When interfacing with other equipment, a test for leakage current must be performed by qualified biomedical engineering personnel before using with patients. 22 If several items of medical equipment are interconnected, pay attention to the sum of the leakage currents, otherwise it may cause shock hazard. Consult your service personnel. 23 During monitoring, if the power supply is off and there is no battery for standby, the monitor will be off. The settings configured by the user (except Screen Layout settings in 5 electrodes/6 electrodes/10 electrodes) can be stored, and settings not configured by user keep no change. That is, the last settings used will be recovered when the power is restored. 24 The device and accessories are to be disposed of according to local regulations after their useful lives. Alternatively, they can be returned to the dealer or the manufacturer for recycling or proper disposal. Batteries are hazardous waste. Do NOT dispose them together with house-hold garbage.

Effects from Water Vapor Partial Pressure on Gas Readings: When the breathing gas flows through the sampling line, the gas temperature will adapt to the ambient temperature before reaching the gas analyzer. The CO measurement will always show the actual partial pressure at the current humidity level in the gas sample. As the NomoLine sampling line removes all condensed water, no water will reach NomoLine ISA CO system However at an ambient temperature of 37 C and a breathing gas with a relative humidity of 95% the CO reading will typically be 6% lower than corresponding partial pressure after removal of all water.
