Chapter 2 Getting Started 2.1 Open the Package and Check Open the package and take out the equipment and accessories carefully. Keep the package material for possible future transportation or storage. Check the components according to the packing list. Cautions ■ Turn the unit off before replacing the batteries. ■ Please use 2 \"AA\" size manganese or alkaline batteries, do not use batteries of other types. Otherwise it may cause fire. ■ New and old batteries, different kinds batteries cannot be put off. Otherwise it may cause ■ battery leakage, heat, rupture, and damage to the monitor. ■ \"+\" and \"-\" polarities of the batteries must match the polarities of the battery compartment as indicated. When the batteries power exhausts, replace with 2 new batteries at the same time. ■ Please take out the batteries when you do not use the device for a long time (more than ten days). Otherwise it may cause battery leakage, beat, rupture, and damage to the monitor. ■ If electrolyte of battery gets in your eyes, immediately rinse with plenty of clean water. Contact a physician immediately. Otherwise it will cause blindness or other hazards. ■ If electrolyte of the batteries immodestly glues on the skin or the clothes, please immediately flush with plenty of clean water. Otherwise it may hurt the skin. ■ Dispose of the exhausted batteries according to applicable local regulations about environmental. Otherwise it will cause environmental pollution. ■ The monitor is internally powered equipment, can be connected to the public grid. 2.3 Power on the Instrument Hold the power button , the indicator will flash once, which shows the boot-strap is successful, then release the button, and the system will enter the main interface. Hold the power button after power on, the indicator will flash once, which shows the shutdown is successful, and the device can be safely terminated. Warning If any sign of damage is detected, or the instrument displays some error messages, do not use it on any patient. Contact biomedical engineer in the hospital or our Customer Service Center immediately. The device can be used normally after it is turned on without waiting for the device to be prepared. Check all the functions that possibly be used and make sure that the device is in good status. 2.4 Connect Sensor For information on correct connection of NIBP cuff, refer to Figure 2.4.1 Figure 2.4.1 Connection Method Connect the sensor between the Monitor and the measure part of the patient. Warning Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurements in Auto mode may be associated with purport, ischemia and neuropathy in the limb wearing the cuff. When monitoring a patient, examine the extremities of the limb frequently for nonnal color, wannth and sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop the blood pressure measurements. Warning You must not perform NIBP measurements on patients with sickle-cell disease or under any condition which the skin is damaged or expected to be damaged. For thrombastbemia patient, it is important to determine whether measurement of blood pressure shall be done automatically. The determination should be based on clinical Warning Before starting a measurement, verify that you have selected a setting appropriate for your patient. (adult, pediatric or neonate). Do not apply the cuff to a limb that has an intravenous infusion or catheter. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when infusion is slowed or blocked during cuff inflation. The minimum value of the patient's physiological signal is the lower limit that the device can measure. The measured result may inaccurate if the device running below the minimum amplitude or minimum value of patient's physiological signal. Do not twist or tangle the airway tube, otherwise it will cause continuous pressure in the cuff, then causing blocked blood flow and serious injury to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the injured area, otherwise it will cause more serious damage to the injured area. Do not use the cuff on the site where intravascular treatment is being performed or with catheter connection, otherwise it may cause temporary blockage of blood flow and then cause injury to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the side of the mastectomy; The pressure by cuff may cause temporary weakness of some functions of the body. So do not use monitoring medical electrical equipment on corresponding arm. Do not move during measuring, because it will have a delayed effect on the patient's blood flow. The device needs 2 hours of recovery time to reach its performance of intended use after Warning Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurements in Auto mode may be associated with purport, ischemia and neuropathy in the limb wearing the cuff. When monitoring a patient, examine the extremities of the limb frequently for normal color, warmth and sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop the blood pressure measurements. 2. To stop auto measuring: During auto measuring, press button at any time to stop auto measurement. Warning If liquid is inadvertently splashed on the equipment or its accessories, or may enter the conduit or inside the monitor, contact local Customer Service Center. Measurement Limitations The oscillometry method has some limitations depending on the patient's condition. This measure is based on the regular pulse wave generated by arterial pressure. In the case where the patient condition makes such a detection method difficult, the measured value becomes unreliable and the measuring time increases. The user should be aware that the following conditions will make the measurement unreliable or measurement time extended. In this case, the patient's condition will make the measurement impossible:  Patient Movement Measurements will be unreliable or cannot perform if the patient is moving, shivering or having convulsions. These motions may interfere with the detection of the arterial pressure pulses. In addition, the measurement time will be prolonged.  Cardiac Arrhythmia's Measurements will be unreliable and may not be possible if the patient's cardiac arrhythmia has caused an irregular heartbeat. The measuring time thus will be prolonged.  Heart-lung Machine Measurements will not be possible if the patient is connected to a heart-lung machine.  Pressure Changes Measurements will be unreliable and may not be possible if the patient's blood pressure is changing rapidly over the period of time during which the arterial pressure pulses are being analyzed to obtain the measurement.  Severe Shock If the patient is in severe shock or hypothermia, measurements will be unreliable since reduced blood flow to the peripheries will cause reduced pulsation of the arteries.  Heart Rate Extremes Measurements cannot be made at a heart rate of less than 40 bpm and greater than 240 bpm.  Obesity patient The thick fat layer of body will reduce the measurement accuracy, because the fat that come from the shock of arteries can not access the cuffs due to the damping. The following conditions may also cause changes in the blood pressure measurement value  After eating (within 1 hour), or having drinks containing alcohol or caffeine, or after smoking, taking exercises or bathing;  Using incorrect posture such as standing or lying down, etc.;  The patient speaks or moves his body during measurement;  When measuring, the patient is nervous, excited, or in unstable emotion;  The room temperature rises or fall sharply, or the environment of measurement often changes;  Measuring in a moving vehicle;  The position of cuff applied (higher or lower than the heart level);  Continuous measurement for a long time; Warning ■ Remove the batteries before cleaning the device or peripheral equipment. The accessories and Safety classification Type BF defibrillation-proof applied part The service life of the device is five years or 10000 times of Service life BP measurement Date of manufacturer See the label Warning  Active medical devices are subject to special EMC precautions and they must be installed and ESD precautions.  The most basic content of the ESD precautionary procedure training should include an introduction to electrostatic charge physics, voltage level in the conventional case, and damage to the electronic components when the operator with electrostatic charge contacts them. In addition, the methods for preventing electrostatic buildup, and the manner and reasons for the release of human body static electricity to the ground or equipment frame or the use of a bracelet to connect the human body to the equipment or the ground before establishing the connection ",
