    "3.3 Manajemen Pasien": "3.8 Patient data Normally the operator needs to input a new patient’s information before scanning the new patient. Alternatively, pull up an old patient’s data from the archive for a new examination of the old patient. Read chapter 4 for reference. 3.9 Image Annotation 3.9.1 Character Annotation Slide the touch panel from left edge to right, \"Comments\", \"BodyPattern\" and \"Measure\" buttons are displayed. Touch \"Comments\" button to enter \"Comments\" page, touch \"Comments\" button, exit comments. At the bottom there are some frequent terms, they can be added on the image by dragging or touching them. Those words will be different based on different applications and probes. Select and hold a certain section of the image area for adding annotations. By selecting and holding the previous comment, it can be edited, with edit field turned green. After the other field is selected, the previous annotation will become a confirmed annotation. After the \"Delete\" is selected, this button will be highlighted and there will be a delete sign appearing beside each comment, the comment can be deleted by selecting the delete sign. After the \"Delete\" is selected again, this key will return to normal and the delete sign for each comment will disappear. 3.9.2 Arrow Indicator Drag arrow indicators on the comment screen to move them to the image area to indicate the nidus. Arrow can be rotated after it is selected. 3.9.3 Body Pattern Touch \"BodyPattern\" button , all body patterns are displayed at the bottom. After one of those patterns is selected, the body pattern box will turn green and the body pattern will appear on the bottom-right side of the image screen for reference. The probe indicator’s orientation and position can be changed. Touch the body pattern on the image to confirm the selection. Touch \"BodyPattern\" button again, exit “BodyPattern”. Note that after returning to the basic UI, the body pattern and probe indicator cannot be changed. By selecting \"Body Pattern\" again, the probe indicator’s direction and position can be changed. Select \"Import\" to import body patterns from a USB memory stick. After the \"Import\" key is selected, the operator can follow the procedure to import body patterns. In this case, the operator has to copy a body pattern from his own PC in JPEG format. In system setting, the size of body pattern can be adjusted. 3.10 Cine Mode While scanning a certain number of frames, after \"Freeze\" button is touched, touch the image area, there is one triangle blue button. Touch the button, the sequence will be replayed continuously. By sliding on the touch panel horizontally the sequence can be reviewed frame by frame. This length of cine loop depends on the number of the scan lines, the scan depth and other parameters. 1. Start Frame, End Frame: control which frame to start from and which to end in order to display continuously as a loop. 2. Speed: controls cine speed as 400%, 200%, 100%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 20%. 3.11 Zoom function Zoom the image with two fingers. Two fingers touch and hold on the image, then move the fingers to increase the distance between them, the image will be zoomed in. The opposite operation will zoom out the image. 3.12 Multiple display formats Select buttons on the touch panel (\"Dual\", \"Quad\", and \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\"). After \"Dual\" on the touch panel is selected, the system will have dual image display. \"A\" position image will be real time and \"A\" button will be highlighted by default. \"B\" position image will be last frame static image at the same mode. Select \"B\" button to active the \"B\" position image. The \"B\" button will be highlighted. Selecting “single” display format button will go back to the normal one image display. After \"Quarter\" on the touch panel is selected, the system will have quarter image display. \"A\" position image will be real time and \"A\" button will be highlighted by default, and the \"A\" button is highlighted. The \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" are the last frame static image. Select the \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\" button to activate \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\" position image. Only one image can be activated at one time. Selecting “single” display format button will go back to the normal one image display. 3.13 2D Image size change In 2D mode, slide up from the bottom. There is a parameter \"Image Angle\". This parameter is used to adjust the image size. 4. Prepare for an Examination and Patient Data Archive Before starting an examination, it is recommended to enter a new patient’s information before begin to scan. The patient information can also be entered while scanning, but the operator needs to determine whether the corresponding image belongs to the patient or not before storing. The operator can pull out the patient’s information from the archive and start a new examination. The patient information is the same as before. For new patient information, the recommendations are as follows: 1. Patient ID. 2. Patient name. 3. Date of Birth/age, gender. This is stored together with the patient’s images and will be transferred with the images of the corresponding patient to the archive. The information and application data below may differ in different examinations and we recommend that it should also be entered. 1. Physician, operator. 2. Basic data in relevant application category. 4.1 Beginning a New Patient Touch patient info area, touch button in pop-up window, enter \"New Patient\" page, there will be an auto ID in \"Patient ID\", the operator can use this ID or input her/his own one. If set \"prefix\" in system setting, the prefix will be added. Select \"Exit\" to go back to the main menu without saving the information. If the operator inputs some information on this page, and select \"Save&Exit\" the system will create a \"new patient\" record and store this information to start scanning. 1. BSA is body’s surface area, and will be automatically calculated when the data above (weight and height) is filled in. 2. The empty box is the data input field. After the relevant place is selected, they can be selected to input number or characters. 3. Either birth date or age needs to be filled in, the other one will be automatically calculated based on the time of the system. For this reason, it is very important that the system time be correct. There are three gender options: N/A, male or female. 4. If the inputted ID is the same with the exited one, the system will give one warning message: There're some patient records match the creating patient, do you want to view details? If there is no patient ID or name, select \"Save & Exit\" on the touch panel and the system will display a message for three options to select from. The options are: \"Exit without new patient\", \"New patient with auto ID’’ and \"Go back to patient page\". Select \"New patient with auto ID\" and the system will automatically give a number for new patient ID. Select \"Exit without new patient\" and the system will go back to real scan mode without patient ID. If \"Go back to patient page\" is selected, the system will go back to the new patient page. 4.1.1 General Data Section Patient ID : ID number, max 30 characters.

Slide up from the bottom of the screen to open 2D mode menu, displays all adjustable parameters, slide down the screen to hide menu. Touch one parameter, the sliding switch or the adjusting arrow button can be increased or decreased according to the different parameters selected. Slide right to display more parameters. All available parameters are as follows: - Image Quality: Select different level “Resolution”, “Normal”, “Penetration” to adjust the image quality. - Frequency: By regulating this parameter, the operator can strike a balance between resolution and penetration. High frequency generally means a better resolution at the cost of a worse penetration. - Focus Position: It is to select the depth of current focus or focuses. The focus position is indicated on the right side. - Focus #: This allows the operator to select the number of focuses. The number of focuses depends on the probe selected. - VFusion: This function enhances the contrast resolution with better tissue differentiation and clear organ borders. When the level is 0, this function is switched - VSpeckle: This function reduces the speckle noise in the ultrasound image. Notes: This process smooths the image, so potentially some structures can be smeared out. - Dynamic Range: This allows the operator to enhance the grayscale to make the image easier to display. - Line density: This helps to keep a balance between the image resolution and the frame rate. A higher line density means a better resolution, but a slower frame rate. - VSharpen: By this function, the edge of the image can be more easily observed with the naked eye. The higher the level of VSharpen, the better the edge of the image can - Image Angle: This function can be used to change the scanning angle. A small angle can provide a faster frame rate, but the scanning area is smaller. - Persistence: Frame averaging can eliminate the image speckle of the 2D images. Several frame averaging levels can be set in this menu. - Gray Filter: Certain echo signals can be filtered by this function to avoid noise. - Smooth: This smoothens out the image by reducing the number of pixels. Focus Width: Using this key change the focus zone width. - Acoustic Power: This allows the operator to change the transmitted acoustic power. - Biopsy: After this button is selected, the biopsy guide line will display on the image screen. Some biopsies have different angles to be selected. If this is the case, the system will display the selectable angles for the operator to select from. Different probes feature different biopsy guide lines. - VNear: In the 2D touch panel menu, use the arrow in the \"VNear\" key to increase or decrease or switch off the level of compounding. When the level is 0, this function is switched off. When the level is 1, 2, 3, one more focus will be added if the position of the current focus is >5 cm. If there are the most focuses, this function doesn’t work. - NeedleEnhance: Only works with linear probes. To enhance the needle image when do biopsy. When this function is enabled, a red boundary line will be displayed to show the effective border which should not be crossed, change its angle to match the needle, make sure the angle between the red line and the needle is 90°. The direction can be changed too. - VTissue: it can automatically calculate the best acoustic velocity in tissue on the basic of the scanning data to improve the image quality. After this button is selected, it will be highlighted to show this function is active. Touch it again to remove this function and the echo speed will return to pre-set one. No \"VTissue\" in HAR mode. - TI: Select thermal index display which is one of TIS, TIB and TIC. TIS is the Soft Tissue Thermal Index. TIB is Bone Thermal index. TIC is Cranial Bone Thermal Index. - SGC (Scanline gain compensation): Gain compensation for tissue image scan line. - Gain: Sliding vertically on the left of the image, the overall brightness of 2D image is adjusted. All incoming echoes are amplified with the same digital gain value regardless of the depth. Turning \"Gain\" control clockwise makes the entire image brighter, and counterclockwise makes the image less bright. The digital gain value is displayed on the screen. - Depth: Sliding vertically on the right of the image, the depth of the image is changed. This change can only be in real time scan mode. 1. Maximum and minimum depth varies according to the different probes used. 2. Actual depth is displayed in the information header. - TGC slides controls: Adjust TGC can vary the gain in the certain depth of the 2D image. - 2D Steer: Steer the 2D image right direction, center (no steer), left direction. The drawing below is shown as reference. 2D steer only exists in the linear probes. - 2D Automatic Optimization: This function can optimize the contrast resolution according to the histogram of the scan area. It causes the automatic optimization of the gray scale to enhance the contrast. - Harmonic Imaging: The harmonic imaging reflects the harmonic of the nominal transmitted frequency, such as double, threefold and fourfold. It gives the better grayscale contrast compared to the standard ultrasound imaging. - L/R and U/D: They allow the operator to fold the image from left to right or right to left and up to down or down to up as shown below for reference. Left/ Right - TView: Trapezoid view will enlarge the scanning area in order to let the operator see more. For example, the linear probe scanning image is a rectangle, but after this function works, the scanning image will change to a trapezoid which has a larger scanning view in the bottom. - Map: The gray map determines the displayed brightness of an echo. With a different gray map, a harder or softer image can be obtained. Image gray can be adjusted both in the freeze and scan mode. There are 2 kind of map: Gray Map and Tint Map. Operator can select map by touching \"< \" or \"> \". 5.1.2 PView Panoramic view function provides the ability to construct and view a static 2D image which is wider than the field of view of the selected probe. It constructs an extended image from the individual image frames as the operator moves the probe along the surface of the skin. Operations in PView 1. Touch \"PView\" to enter \"PView\" mode. 2. To start acquiring the image, touch \"Start\". Then move the probe slowly, steadily and in uniform motion lengthwise. Make sure that the probe stays in one plane throughout the scan. The image is stored as you perform the scan and can be monitored during acquisition. 3. To complete the scan, select \"Stop\". 4. Touch \"Reacquisition\" to clear the extended image and return to the normal image, and the operator can start again. Selecting the \"Exit\" on the touch panel goes back to the normal image scan. The quality and usefulness of the extended images is impacted by the probe motion. The incorrect technique can generate a defective image. A good quality extended image is characterized by the smooth edges and a clear direction. All structures visible in properly scanned 2D images can be easily identified. A poor quality extended image can be recognized by its rough and curved edges. Also, it may contain sections showing noise and defects next to sections of clear structures. If any poor quality extended image has been generated, the scan has to be repeated and the poor image considered as useless. Any measurement based on a poor image is to be considered not correct. Note that the accuracy of measurement in the extended images is limited and can be lower than measurement on the B images. It is not recommended to use this measurement: be aware that any diagnostic conclusion must not be made based on panoramic image alone and needs to be checked with other diagnostic procedures. Precaution for uniform motions as follows:  Make sure that there is enough gel along the scan path.  Move the probe slowly and steadily.  It must be ensured that the probe during the acquisition of the extended image always remains in contact with the skin.  Keep the motion within the same scan plane and do not change the direction of movement during the scan.  Deeper scanning needs slower motion of the probe due to more data acquisition 5.1.3 Freeze in B/HAR mode Touch \"Freeze\" button to enter freeze mode, some parameters will be hidden. Touch the screen, it will display progress bar. There is one triangle blue button. Touch the button, operator can replay the image. Control which frame to start from by drag the process bar. The frozen image can be optimized by adjusting the parameters or changing the maps when Note: In Freeze mode, no adjustment is available for the \"Frequency\", \"Focus Position\", \"Focus #\", \"Line Density\", \"VSharpen\". 5.2 M Mode The \"M\" mode imaging provides the echo information of motion with change of time derived from a stationary ultrasound beam. \"M\" mode is used along with a 2D image, with one line through the 2D image which is called the \"M\" cursor. This cursor identifies the position of the ultrasound beam. The motion of the echo information at this position over time is to display \"M\" mode. 5.2.1 M mode - Activation of M mode: By touching \"M\", the system goes to \"M\" mode. M cursor can be moved. 2D and \"M\" mode stopped by touching \"Freeze\". - Display format: Operator can change the display format: \"H 1/2\", “H3/4\" ,\"Full\", \"V2/3\", \"V1/2\", and \"V1/3\". - Dynamic Range: This allows the operator to enhance the grayscale range to make it easier to display pathology. - Acoustic Power: This can adjust the transmit power by selecting the up/down key. - Sweep Speed: This can adjust the different sweep speeds by touching the left/right arrows on the control panel which matches the relevant touch panel indicator. - Gray Filter: It determines the threshold above which the ultrasound echoes are displayed on the screen in order to suppress the smaller echoes. The Gray Filter value is displayed in the relevant information area on the touch panel. - VSharpen: This allows the existing information easily visible through the digitally processing. - Gain: This can adjust the overall brightness of the \"M\" mode trace. The adjustment of the \"Gain\" control determines the amplified amount which applied to the received echoes. \"M\" gain function only influences the M trace. 5.2.2 Freeze in M mode After freeze the system, the image will be in the single frame display status. The operator can slide the touch panel horizontally to recall the stored M sequence. By selecting the blue triangle can be changed to the Cine mode. The 2D image will be automatically replayed. The start frame and end one can be changed in the \"B\" menu. By sliding the touch panel horizontally, the 2D image can be reviewed frame by frame. 6. CF (Color Flow Mode) / PDI (Power-Doppler Mode) The Color Flow imaging and Power Doppler imaging uses the Doppler principle to build the image. It gives the information about blood flow velocity, direction, quality and timing. This information is used to overlay a color image onto the 2D grayscale scan image. 6.1 CF mode operation 6.1.1 Main menus of CF mode - The activation of CF mode: Touching \"CF\" button will activate the \"CF\" mode. Then, the \"CF\" box appears in the active 2D image. 1. The \"B/HAR\" button is for the operator to switch to \"B/HAR\" mode parameter change. If \"PW\" is on, the \"PW\" button can let the operator switch to \"PW/CW\" screen for parameter change. 2. The \"PDI\" mode does not have an \"Invert\" button. - Flow Speed: Select different level “Low”, “Medium”, “High” to adjust the image - Frequency: This setting controls the transmit frequency. With a higher frequency, the lower flow velocities are displayed better at the given PRF, but the penetration depth is reduced. With a lower frequency, the sensitivity in depth will be increased. - PRF: The Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) governs the displayed velocity range. Increasing the PRF will increase the range of velocity. High PRF will avoid aliasing of blood. However, higher PRF will have a loss of sensitivity to low flow velocities. - Wall Filter: Wall motion filters are used to eliminate the vessel wall motion and the cardiac motion noise that is low in the velocity and high in the intensity. - Packet Size: It controls the number of samples gathered for a single color flow vector. This allows the operator to improve the color sensitivity and accuracy of color averaging if increasing the packet size or increase the frame rate if decreasing the packet size. - Color Level: This function eliminates the small color noise or motion artifact signals. - L/R: After this button is selected, the image will be folded from left to right and right - U/D: After this button is selected, the image will be folded from up to down and down to up. - Invert: This function inverts the color display in relation to the direction of the flow. Normally the red color represents flow to the probe and the blue color represents away from the probe. After inverting, the color will represent different. - Color map: Those allow the operator to select different color-coding for blood flow display (similar to the post-processing curves with gray scale of B image). Operator can select map by touching \"< \" or \"> \". - Line density: It determines the line density within the \"CF\" box. - Sync Display: After this button is selected, there will be two images on main screen, the left one is 2D image, the right one is 2D+CF image. - Persistence: It smooths the image by performing a temporal averaging which improves the appearance of the color image. - Flash Reduction: It reduces movement artifacts in the image. - Line density: Higher line density will improve the resolution and the reduce frame - Base Line: It can be used to prevent aliasing in one flow direction, similar to the Doppler baseline shift. Shifting baseline will enlarge the velocity range in one direction. - Transparency: Indicates the visibility of background image. - Acoustic Power: It adjusts transmit acoustic power. The higher acoustic power has better penetration. - Steer: Steer the CF image right direction, center (no steer), left direction. After the system enters frozen mode, sliding on the touch panel horizontally reviews the image frame by frame, similar to the \"B\" mode. 1. In Frozen mode, there will be no panoramic view function. 2. Start Frame, End Frame: control which frame to start from and which to end in order to display continuously as a loop. 3. Speed: control cine speed as 400%, 200%, 100%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 20%. 4. In frozen mode, \"B\" or \"PW/CW\" mode (if available) can be switched, for adjustment by selecting the mode tabs. 6.1.2 CF box position and size The ability to change the \"CF\" mode box size and the position can provide the flexibility in imaging. The box size can be changed by 2 fingers like zoom function in B/HAR mode. And the box position can be changed by touching and moving it with finger. 6.1.3 CF mode gain control Adjust the \"CF\" mode digital gain in order to change the sensitivity. If \"CF\" gain control is too low, it will be difficult to detect the small abnormalities in flow and will possibly result in an underestimation of the large flow disturbances. If \"CF\" gain control is too high, the noise will be introduced and disturb normal flow detection. So \"CF\" gain needs to be adjusted properly to ensure continuous flow display, and also be set as high as possible unless the random color speckle appears. 6.1.4 Power Doppler (PDI) Power Doppler is intended to compensate some deficit of the Color Doppler. Its advantages comparing Color Doppler are less dependent on the incident angle, no aliasing, less dependent on the direction, and sensitive to slow flow. After \"PDI\" button is touched, the system will enter \"PDI\" mode. The layout is similar with the color mode. However, the color bar will have a difference: in the color mode, the color bar has two colors to indicate the flow direction (To probe is red, away from probe is blue), \"PDI\" color bar does not have the direction information and it indicates the power of flow. \"PDI\" menu is similar with the color mode. However, all velocity-determined functions are not available in \"PDI\"; for example, there is no \"Invert\" button. The operation of \"PDI\" is similar to Color Doppler too and can refer to \"CF\" mode operation. 7. PW mode (Spectral Doppler Mode) The spectral Doppler describes the Doppler shift signal within a sample volume. It displays scroll from left to right and displays the spectral distribution of Doppler shift frequency over time. The frequency or velocity values appear on the vertical axis and time along the horizontal axis. The strong or weak signal is displayed as varying shades of gray. The strong signals are displayed as bright while the weaker signals are less bright. 7.1 PW mode (Pulsed Wave Doppler) A sample volume cursor is located on the \"PW\" cursor and it indicates where, along the ultrasound beam, the spectral analysis is being performed. Operation of PW mode (main menu) After \"PW\" is touched, the system will enter \"PW\" mode. - Flow Speed: Select different level “Low”, “Medium”, “High” to adjust the image - Sample volume position and width: In \"PW\", a specific area along the ultrasound beam is sampled. This is called the sample volume, which is located on the ultrasound beam and is displayed as two lines perpendicular to the beam line. The location and the size of the volume can be changed. The location of sample volume can be adjusted. - PW automatic optimization: To perform the auto optimization, the system will automatically detect the highest flow velocity and adjust the velocity scale (PRF) accordingly in order to display the velocity in full scale properly. At the same time, the baseline will be shifted in order to display the full spectrum. - Display format: Operator can change the display format. In format, there are two kinds of display. One is side by side, while the other one is up and down. In each type of the format, different splits bet ween \"B\" and \"PW\" traces displays can be selected. In side by side forat, there are three kinds:\"H1/2\",\"H3/4\" and \"Full\". In up and down, there are three kinds: \"V2/3\",\"V1/2\" and \"V1/3\". The \"V2/3\" display format is as shown below. - Invert: This function inverts the \"PW\" spectrum display in relation to the direction of flow. The displayed spectrum is inverted around the baseline. The velocity or frequency scale changes accordingly. After \"Invert\" on the touch panel is selected, this function will work. Spectrum above baseline is the blood flow towards the transducer and spectrum below baseline is the blood flow away from the transducer in normal orientation. In invert status, the orientation will be opposite. - Trace Direction: The operator can also select different trace directions to be \"Above\", \"Below\" or both them. \"Above\" means that the trace will be along the curve of the spectrum above the baseline. \"Below\" means that the trace will be along the curve of the spectrum below the baseline. Selecting both them means that the trace will be along the curve of the spectrum above and below the baseline. The corresponding evaluation is automatically displayed on the monitor and updated in every heart cycle. There are vertical dotted lines to indicate the latest 1- 5 cycle(s), the number of cycle is configured by \"Heart Cycle\" in PW page. \"+\" means the peak of the spectrum. - Trace Mode: Operator can select trace mode to be \"Max\", \"Mean\", or both them. If none of them is highlighted, auto trace is disabled. - Heart Cycle: 1-5 cycles can be selected. - Trace Sensitivity: Select the trace sensitivity to balance the sensitivity and artifacts. The high sensitivity settings may cause artifacts. The low sensitivity may cause smoothing to some incident events. - Acoustic Power: By pressing \"Acoustic Power\" on the touch panel can change the transmit power. The high acoustic power output has better penetration. - PRF: The velocity range on display is controlled by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). As the PRF increases, the velocity measurable range is increased too. As the display scale increases, the maximum Doppler shift information can be increased. The relevant up/down key increases or reduces PRF. Possible the maximum sampling frequency can be automatically adapted based on the sample volume depth. After the certain level of PRF is exceeded, the system is activated into \"HPRF\" (high PRF mode) mode which can increase the maximum measurable flow velocity further. The normal maximum measurable flow velocity is determined by the measuring depth of the sample volume. In order to further increase measurable flow velocity to reach the normal limitation, one or more additional sample volumes is added along with the ultrasound beam cursor as the virtual sample volume. The blood flows recorded by the virtual sample volume are overlaying the actual Doppler signal of the main sample volume. - Baseline: The change of \"PW\" spectrum baseline can enlarge the velocity range in one direction. The displayed velocities or the frequencies on the upper and lower edge of the screen show the maximum measuring velocity range. The up/down key corresponding to baseline can change it up or down. - Steer: PW line can be steered. Only works with linear probes. - Angle Correct: To obtain the optimum resolution and the accuracy from the Doppler measurements, the angle which is between the ultrasound beam and the blood flow should be maintained between 0 and 20 degrees in order to display the vessel in longitudinal section and the angle cursor must be positioned parallel to the vessel - Sweep Speed: The faster sweep speed may be useful to analyze flow curves. Frequency and Wall Filter can be adjusted the same as color mode. - Audio Volume: This allows to change the volume of the audio signal for the \"PW\" - Gray Filter: In order to eliminate low level echoes caused by noise, the operator can adjust this value to remove the certain level of echoes before processing. - Dynamic Range: The \"Dynamic range\" refers to the compression of the grayscale information into suitable range for the display. It can enhance a certain grayscale range which makes it easier to display pathology. When increasing dynamic range, this will decrease the brightness to more gray shades and less contrast. When decreasing the dynamic range, it will increase the brightness to be less gray shades and more contrast. - Spectrum Optimize: It processes several near-by spectra to optimize spectrum display. The identified number indicates a number of spectra to be processed. 7.2 Freeze in PW After \"Freeze\" is touched, the image will be in single frame display status. Operator can replay image by sliding left and right on 2D image. If selecting \"Duplex\", and touching \"Freeze\", both the 2D and \"PW\" image will freeze. At this moment, selecting \"2D\" button to switch to B menu, operator can replay 2D image. 8.

Measurement and Calculation The measurement and calculation results from the ultrasound image can be used to supplement other clinical approaches. Its measurement accuracy depends not only on the system accuracy, but also on the impact of different medical approaches. If necessary, indicate the medical approach relevant to the measurement and calculation. In the meantime, record the details of the researcher and calculation method and database in the system. Refer to the relevant original article as some clinical operation approaches are recommended by researchers.

Use of legally marketed, sterile probe sheath is strongly recommended for intra operative procedures. Instructions Each probe sheath kit consists of a flexible and elastic sheath which can cover the probe and cable. DO NOT use an expired sheath. Before using probe sheaths, verify whether the term of validity has expired. Also read sheath document careful to avoid allergic reaction in sensitive individuals. 13.3 Probe handling and infection control This information is intended to increase user awareness of the risks of disease transmission associated with using this equipment and provide guidance in making decisions directly affecting the safety of the patient as well as the equipment user. Diagnostic ultrasound systems utilize ultrasound energy that must be coupled to the patient by direct physical contact. Depending on the type of examination, this contact occurs with a variety of tissues ranging from intact skin in a routine exam to re-circulating blood in a surgical procedure. The level of risk of infection varies greatly with the type of contact. One of the most effective ways to prevent transmission between patients is with single use or disposable devices. However, ultrasound transducers are complex and expensive devices that must be reused between patients. It is very important, therefore, to minimize the risk of disease. Risk of Infection: ALWAYS clean and disinfect the probe between patients to the level appropriate for the type of examination and use cleared probe sheaths where appropriate. Adequate cleaning and disinfection is necessary to prevent disease transmission. It is the responsibility of the equipment user to verify and maintain the effectiveness of the infection control procedures in use. Always use sterile, legally marketed probe sheaths for intra operative procedures. For neurological intra-operative procedures, use of a legally marketed, sterile, pyrogen free probe sheath is REQUIRED. robes for neuro surgical use must not be sterilized with liquid chemical sterilants because of the possibility of neuro toxic residues remaining on the probe. 13.4 Probe Safety Ultrasound probes are highly sensitive medical devices that can easily be damaged by improper handling. DO NOT use a damaged or defective probe. Failure to follow these precautions can result in serious injury and equipment damage. 13.5 Cleaning and Disinfecting Probes Refer to the user documentation enclosed with these probes. You MUST disconnect the probe from the USG PRO SCANNER prior to cleaning/disinfecting the probe. Failure to do so could damage the system. 13.5.1 Cleaning Probes Cleaning procedure 1. Disconnect the probe from the unit. 2. Remove the coupling gel by wiping the probe lens with a soft cloth. 3. Wipe the probe and cable with a soft cloth moisten in a warm soap and water solution (<80oF/27oC). 4. Wipe the probe and cable with a soft cloth moisten in clean water (<80oF/27oC) until all soap is removed. 5. Wipe dry with a soft towel. To minimize the risk of infection from blood-borne pathogens, you must handle the probe and all disposables which have contacted blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin in accordance with infection control procedures. You must wear protective gloves when handling potentially infectious material. Use a face shield and gown if there is a risk of splashing or splatter. 13.5.2 Disinfecting probes Disinfecting probes Although representing a necessary step in protecting patients and employees from disease transmission, liquid chemical germicides must also be selected to minimize potential damage to the transducer. It is important to use germicides of probe recommended by PT. SINKO PRIMA ALLOY. Below is the list of germicides for each probe:  Alkazyme  Klenzyne  Steranios 2%  Cidex OPA Disinfection After cleaning, the probe and cable may be wiped with a tissue sprayed with a recommended disinfectant. When decontaminating an infected probe, use additional precautions such as gloves and gown. Returning/shipping probes and repair parts When return a probe or part for service, needs to clean and disinfect the probe or part prior to packing and shipping this device. Ensure that the follow probe cleaning and disinfection instruction. This ensures that the employees in the transportation industry as well as the people who receive the package are protected from any risk. 13.6 Coupling Gels Do not use gels (lubricants) that are not recommended. They may damage the probe and void the In order to assure optimal transmission of energy between the patient and probe, a conductive gel or couplant must be applied liberally to the patient where scanning will be performed. We do not recommend that the operator use colored ultrasound gel. Long-term use may cause discoloration of the probe housing, although the discoloration does not affect the performance and functionality of the probe. PT. SINKO PRIMA ALLOY Alamat : Jl.

General 1.1 Introduction USG PRO SCANNER (hereinafter referred to as \"this device\") is a professional digital color ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus. It transmits ultrasound waves into the body tissues and displays the echo images of the tissues and blood flow accordingly. This series includes the following models: - Linear Probe Q5-7L - Convex Probe Q5-3C - Phased Array Probe Q5-2P Principles of Operation Medical ultrasound images are created by computer and digital memory from the transmission and reception of mechanical high-frequency waves applied through a probe. The mechanical ultrasound waves spread through the body, producing an echo where density changes occur. For example, in the case of human tissue, an echo is created where a signal passes from an adipose tissue (fat) region to a muscular tissue region. The echoes return to the probe where they are converted back into electrical signals. These echo signals are highly amplified and processed by several analog and digital circuits that use filters with many frequency and time response options to transform the high-frequency electrical signals into a series of digital image signals which are stored in memory. Once in memory, the image can be displayed in real-time on the image monitor. A probe is an accurate, solid-state device, providing multiple image formats. The digital design and use of solid-state components provide highly stable and consistent imaging performance with minimal required maintenance. 1.2 Contact Information This device is developed and manufactured by PT.

There are three thermal index categories:  TIS: soft tissue thermal index, the main TI category. Used for the applications that does not image (or visualize) bones.  TIB: bone thermal index (bone located in a focal region). Used for the fetal application.  TIC: cranial bone thermal index (bone located close to the surface). Used for the transcranial application. Mechanical Index: MI is the estimated likelihood of tissue damage due to the cavitation. Safety statement: Although no harmful biological effects have been demonstrated for ultrasound frequencies, intensities and exposure times, we recommend the operator to use the lowest acoustic output settings producing acceptable diagnostic information. Caution: Ultrasound can produce harmful effects in tissue and potentially result in patient injury. Always minimize exposure time and keep ultrasound levels low when there is no medical benefit. Use the principle of ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable), increasing output only when needed to obtain diagnostic image quality. Observe the acoustic output display and be familiar with all controls affecting the output level. See the Bioeffects section of the Acoustic Output chapter in the Advanced Reference Manual for more information. Caution: The operator of the device must sufficiently understand the acoustic output and be able to obtain the related thermal index values. The probe with self-heating in the air cannot be used in transvaginal scanning. Always minimize exposure time to the irradiation and keep ultrasound acoustic output level low for embryos or fetuses. System controls affecting acoustic output: The TI and MI show the highest possible acoustic intensity for a given mode, obtainable only when the combination of control settings that results in maximum output is selected. Most settings result in a much lower output. There are several notes as follows:  The duration of an ultrasound examination is as important as the acoustic output, since the patient exposure to output is directly relevant to the ultrasound scanning  The better image quality can accelerate the clinical result, reducing the overall duration of an examination. Therefore, any image quality improvement can help to reduce patient exposure. Probe selection: As long as the appropriate application is available, any probe of this device can be used and meet the limitation of the acoustic output requirement. Application selection: Selecting the probe and application will provide the acoustic output within the limitation of the acoustic output requirement. Changing imaging modes: Acoustic output depends on the imaging mode selected. The choice of mode will greatly affect the energy absorbed by the tissue. After a combined mode is completed, such as 2D and CF mode, the total acoustic output comprises contributions from each individual mode. Concerning surrounding fetal exposure: Always be aware of the acoustic output level by observing the acoustic output display. The operator is recommended to become familiar with this device’s controls affecting the acoustic OB examination: Prior to an ultrasound examination, the patient should be informed of the clinical applications which include specific benefits, potential risks and alternatives. In addition, if the patient requires information about the exposure time and intensity, they should be provided. An ultrasound examination should not be performed to satisfy the family’s desire to know the fetal sex: according to several countries’ laws, which include China, using an ultrasound examination to detecting the fetal sex (gender) is prohibited. 2.5.2 Patient Safety The concerns listed in this section can seriously affect the safety of the patient undergoing a diagnostic ultrasound examination. Patient Identification: Always include proper identification with all patient data and verify the accuracy of the patient’s name and/or the identity number after entering the data. Ensure all recorded data has the correct patient ID. Identification errors can result in an incorrect diagnosis. Diagnostic Information: The images and calculations provided by this device are intended for use by the competent the operator, as a diagnostic tool. They are explicitly not to be regarded as the sole basis for the clinical diagnosis. The operator is encouraged to study the literature and reach their own professional conclusions regarding the clinical utility of this device. Special care is required to ensure the maximum privacy of the patient information. 2.5.3 Probe Safety Mechanical hazards: Damaged probes or the improper use of probes may result in injury or increased the risk of infection. The operator needs to frequently inspect the probe for damage, in particular looking for sharp or rough surface damage. If any defects or damages are found on the probe or its cable, DO NOT use the ultrasound diagnostic system. Contact your service representative. Inspect probes frequently for cracks or openings in the housing and holes in and around acoustic lens or other damage. 2.5.4 Personnel and equipment safety Explosion hazard: Never operate this device in the presence of flammable or explosive liquids, vapors or gases. The operator should be aware of the points to prevent such explosion hazards as follows:  If flammable substances are detected in the environment, do not plug in or turn on this device.
