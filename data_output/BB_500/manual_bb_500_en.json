The skin temperature probe must be attached to the baby's skin very carefully. If it is incorrectly attached or accidentally detached from the baby, the baby's skin temperature cannot be accurately detected, especially in the skin temperature control mode, which will cause the risk of overheating. 4. Skin temperature setting (Skin temperature control mode) In the skin temperature control mode, the temperature control of the incubator is mainly to maintain the baby's skin temperature. It uses a skin temperature probe attached to the baby's abdomen to detect the baby's skin temperature, and maintains the optimal thermal environment through feedback control. In the skin temperature control mode, the temperature of the incubator is automatically controlled to keep the baby's skin temperature at a constant level; If the baby's skin temperature is lower than the set temperature, the temperature of the incubator will rise. If the baby's skin temperature is higher than the set temperature, the temperature of the incubator will drop. First in the box temperature control mode, after the temperature in the box reaches a stable state, the baby is placed in the incubator, and then the skin temperature control mode is started. (1) Connect the blue skin temperature sensor plug to skin temperature 1 of the power supply box on the back of the incubator.

Under the guidance of the clinician, the operator should select the appropriate irradiation intensity based on the patient's condition and Table 8-1, and review the effect of phototherapy every 4 hours to determine whether to change the level of irradiation intensity. Table 8-1 Blue light irradiation intensity, irradiation distance, effective area and gear table Use with incubator, irradiation distance: 360mm, effective irradiation area: 400mm × 300mm Average value of total Maximum value of total bilirubin irradiance bilirubin irradiance （μW/cm2） （μW/cm2） High 3600 4500 Middle 2500 3200 Low 1150 1450 Note: The distance between the lower surface of the phototherapy light box and its effective surface is the irradiation distance. The center of the effective surface irradiated by the light box coincides with the center of the baby mattress. The maximum value of total bilirubin irradiance on the effective surface is the maximum total bilirubin irradiance Ebi max; the average value of all points between total bilirubin irradiance Ebi min and Ebi max is total bilirubin Irradiance mean Ebi avg. 1 Effective distance 2 Effective area Effective surface size and its position relative to the phototherapy (5) The blue light irradiation intensity of the machine can be selected from high, medium and low，The blue light irradiation intensity can be adjusted by pressing the key , the switching sequence is: high → mid → low → pause; there are corresponding symbols on the display screen to indicate the current radiation intensity mode, as shown in Figure 8-1, all three symbols are solid When the radiation intensity is high-end; two solid, one hollow, the radiation intensity is mid-range; one solid, two hollow, the radiation intensity is low-level; when all three are hollow, the blue light beads are temporarily closed, that is, Is suspended. Figure8-1 Irradiance mode display After the power is subdivided, turn on the device again, and the machine automatically returns to the last subdivided photo intensity The temperature of the child should be checked regularly during phototherapy. According to the situation, the baby should be properly replenished with fluid. (6) Use of timer 1) When the device is in the pause state, the timer stops counting and displays the time of this irradiation in the format of \"hour: minute: second\"; press the key again, the blue light bead will continue to light, and the timer will continue to count time. 2) The blue light box has the functions of turning off the blue light regularly and accumulating time. When the timer setting is not performed, the default phototherapy time is 100 hours, and it will stop automatically when the time comes. The time displayed by the cumulative timer function is the sum of the phototherapy time from the first use to the current implementation. It is displayed in the format of \"XXXXX.X\" hours. The maximum accumulated time is 19999.9 hours. 3) Clear the timer: Hold down the key without letting go. After a few seconds, the timer resets the current use time to zero. 4) The method of setting the irradiation time (timely turning off the blue light) is shown in Figure 8-2: a) Press and hold the key for a few seconds to enter the countdown setting mode. The default countdown time is 1 hour. To change this time, press or to increase or decrease the countdown lighting time.

Figure8-2 Setting the countdown time b) If the irradiation time is set when the blue light lamp is lit, the blue light lamp continues to work normally with the irradiation intensity; if the irradiation time is set when the blue light is paused, and the blue light lamp beads are automatically lit, the irradiation intensity is High- end; the time display starts to gradually decrease the set time (that is, the countdown starts) until the display is 0 and the irradiation stops. (If \"03:30:00\" is displayed during the countdown, it means that there is 3 hours and 30 minutes before the end of the light) 5）View the progressive time: press the key for a few seconds, the incremental time will be displayed, and then the original display will be restored by itself. (Note: The accumulated time is displayed in decimal time, and the unit is (7) After the phototherapy is finished, please turn off the phototherapy lamp switch and unplug the power plug. 1）The normal timing is incrementing timing, which displays the current phototherapy time, up to 100 hours; the timing is decreasing, which displays the remaining time of phototherapy, up to 48 hours. 2）After the power is turned off (turn off the switch), the phototherapy time resets itself to zero, and the accumulated timing information is permanently stored, unless it is reset to zero by using the \"clear\" button. 22. Precautions (1) This equipment must be operated by trained qualified medical personnel。 (2) Infant skin should be bare in treatment, hat and socks will also effect the treatment result. (3) When the distance is shortened, the power density of the blue light illuminance increases, which will improve the treatment effect, but also increase the treatment substitution. In fact, the scattered illumination is limited by the height of the sensor cover, so the distance between the baby mattress and the light box is fixed between 30CM ~ 50CM, and users must not change it without authorization. (4) The use of phototherapy equipment may affect the child's body temperature, and it is necessary to measure the child's body temperature; phototherapy may also affect the water balance of some children. To prevent the lack of water, children need to be supplemented with fluids. (5) During phototherapy, the patient's bilirubin value should be measured regularly. (6) The lens surface must be cleaned frequently. The Plexiglas on the top of the baby cabin should be kept clean and transparent to ensure the effect of phototherapy. (7) As the distance between the phototherapy device and the effective surface increases, the average value of total bilirubin irradiance will decrease; as the distance decreases, the average value of total irradiance will increase. (8) The figure below shows the irradiance curve with a wavelength range of 400nm to 550nm and an interval of 5nm. (9) LED lamp beads have a service life of 20,000 hours. When the cumulative operation of the blue light tube exceeds the expected life, the irradiance may decay by more than 25%. All LED lamp beads must be replaced to ensure the treatment effect (10) When replacing the lamp beads, the special LED lamp beads specified by the manufacturer must be used, otherwise the safety and effectiveness of the phototherapy equipment will be affected. (11) Only use the parts specified by our company (including adapters and LED lamp beads) when repairing the product, otherwise the safety and effectiveness of the equipment will be reduced. (12) The calibration curve of the blue light radiometer for measuring the total irradiance of bilirubin is shown in the figure below. The abscissa represents the wavelength of the radiant light and the ordinate represents the spectral sensitivity of the blue light radiometer. (13) For neonatal patients with severe jaundice, light therapy should also be used in combination with drugs, and even combined with blood exchange therapy to prevent phototherapy alone. The effect is not ideal and affects the treatment of children. (14) When observing baby skin color for diagnosis, a white light source should be used to prevent blue light from affecting skin color observation. (15) Protective devices intended to prevent the patient from leaving the effective surface area (eg cribs, front doors, etc.) must be regularly checked for safety functions. (16) The maintenance period of the phototherapy accessory is 2 months. Be sure to replace the LED lamp beads after the total bilirubin irradiance is attenuated by 25%. (17) The safety requirements of equipment auxiliary devices shall meet the general safety requirements of GB 9706.1: 2007. (18) The service life of this equipment is 6 years. At the end of life, the product should be disposed of in a timely manner. The disposal of product waste must meet the requirements of laws and regulations. (19) Do not use in the environment with portable and mobile RF communication equipment, so as not to affect the normal operation of the product. 23. Cautions (1) During the phototherapy process, the temperature of the incubator will rise, and you should follow the doctor's instructions. (2) Because a mature baby emits a lot of heat, if you put the baby in an incubator for light treatment, the temperature of the incubator may rise. If you use multiple phototherapy devices at the same time or the room temperature is too high, the air temperature in the incubator will also increase. (3) The use of phototherapy equipment in the incubator increases the supply of heat, but the temperature controller of the incubator will automatically reduce the heating power of the heating tube, so that the air temperature in the equipment meets the requirements. However, as the phototherapy equipment may increase the child's body temperature, it is recommended to use skin temperature control or reduce the box temperature setting value according to the measurement of the child's body temperature when implementing phototherapy. 。 (4) During phototherapy, the child's eyes must be covered with an opaque black cloth or an eye mask should be worn to avoid damage to the patient's retina during light exposure. The eye mask should be tight and tight. (5) During phototherapy, the genitals should be covered with diapers to prevent damage to genital function. (6) Photoisomers of bilirubin may cause toxic effects during phototherapy. (7) Patients near the phototherapy device can be protected with a black cloth barrier to prevent its impact; if the operator is exposed to the phototherapy device for a long time, it may be affected. (8) Use an opaque cloth curtain to cover the thermostat for protection, which will affect the nursing staff's care and observation of the child. It is recommended to increase the frequency of child monitoring, and if necessary, a transparent observation window should be retained for real-time observation. (9) Due to the actinic effect of the medicine, it is forbidden to store the medicine and injection solution in the irradiation area of the phototherapy device. (10) Prohibit the use of flammable agents to wipe or disinfect the phototherapy equipment. (11) Phototherapy equipment should not be used in the presence of combustion-supporting gases (eg oxygen, nitrogen oxides, anesthetic (12) Contraindications: It is strictly forbidden to use a phototherapy device to irradiate children with a body temperature higher than 37.7°C and children with directly elevated bilirubin 7.7 Downside Phototherapy Unit 24.
