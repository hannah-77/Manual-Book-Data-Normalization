    "4.3 Perawatan": "1.2.4 Medical treatment It’s mainly used for air sterilization in sickroom and operating room that ozone is generalized in China but many therapeutic researches have been conducted abroad. Physicians and dentists in Germany, Swizerland, Russia, France and Italiahave applied ozone in treatment for many years, such as using ozone water in oral operation and artificial teeth mounting to keep oral cavity gem free, treating cancer with ozone and radiation therapy combined, drinking ozone water to cure gynecological diseases, and injecting ozone to cure fistula, piles and varicosity,etc. 1.3 Proper use ozone is safe and harmless 1.3.1 As a gaseous sterilant, ozone can effectively kill virus, bacterium, mould and other microbes depending on its oxidizationcapacity. Like any antiseptic, it will cause certainphysiolohical reaction and even damage, but the amount is much less than normal antiseptics, and is easier to protect. On smelling its specific odor, mucous membrane in respiratory tract will response to cause dry mouth and cough: strong stimulation will cause sore tthroat and lassitude; it will need a few hours to recover, but there is still not a case of death caused by ozone. As an antiseptic with vigorous sterilization capacity, ozone can automatically decompose. Leaving no any remaining pollution. Discomfort will immediately vanish once leaving the site, and it’s hard for formaldehyde, peroxyacetic acid, potassium permanganate, and other common antiseptics to match. 1.3.2 Industrial health standards for ozone: Internasional Ozone Association: 0.1 PPm, contact period 10 hours. USA:0.1 PPm , contact period 8 hours. Germany, France, Japan: 0.1PPm. China PR:0.15. 2. Brief introduction of OZ series ozone generator 2.1 IGBT technique (from Germany Infineon Technologies AG) is adopted in this series of ozone generators. Ozone is generated by corona discharge, and the discharge chamber is composed of de-hydroxyl tube-form generators. Particular anti-backwater design makes it service life much longer than that of ordinary factories. Modular design is adopted in electrical circuit. Dielectric element, pipeline and fastening for conveying ozone are all ozone-resistant to ensure long service life, enough corona density, low temperature, and much higher ozone concentration. 3. Composition 3.1 Generator unit (electric circuit board, high-voltage generator, discharge chamber), stainless steel external cabinet, 65L air pump (maybe some products are not equipped with 65L air pumps), ammeter, 150 type fan from Taiwan, connection tube line, ozone regulating apparatus, indicating light. 4.
