Electromagnetism is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcasts, and TV broadcasts cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength at the location where the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance levels above, the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR must be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be required, such as reorientation or relocation of the OXYGEN CONCENTRATOR. b. In the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, the field strength should be less than 3 V/m. ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION 1.
