Algorithm description This section describes the scoring algorithms, formulas, and conditions for interpretation items related to the ECG auto-measurement and auto- interpretation functions. Electrocardiograph The 12-lead synchronized ECG waveform passes through the filters (AC, EMG, DFT (if available, and open)) into the automatic measurement and interpretation module. The automatic measurement and automatic interpretation module mainly includes the process of locating the cardiac impulse, finding the start/end for each wave, its amplitude, calculation, parameter calculation, and interpretation assessment based on known parameters. The workflow is shown as below: Electrocardiograph 3.1 Find the location of the cardiac impulse 1) Pre-processing of data, getting trend of absolute value of slope for each lead; then overlays each absolute value, obtaining a superimposed graph of the absolute value of the slope. 2) Superimposed graph smoothing filter 80ms width average, get DDD analytics data source. 3) Find the location of the cardiac impulse, provide an initial threshold for searching, scan the data regularly in the DDD analytical data source, then compare it with the threshold value: When the value is greater than the threshold, it may be the start of the qrs-complex. If the distance from the previous qrs complex to the current location is less than 150ms then drop the location. Otherwise, take 1/4 of the threshold value for reference, find the start of the qrs complex within 100ms before the current location. When the value is less than the threshold value, it may be the end of the qrs-complex. take 1/4 of the threshold value as reference, find the end of qrs-complex. If the found qrs complexes are wide, these qrs complexes should be excluded. Otherwise, save the qrs-complex. 4) Search: after finding the qrs-complex, find the point of maximum value between the start point and end point on the original ECG data, mark that point as the location of the heart impulse. 5) Dynamic threshold adjustment: after finding the location of the heart impulse, use the value at the location of the heart impulse for dynamic adaptive adjustment of the threshold value. Determine the threshold value as 1/3 of the average of the three closest cardiac impulses. 6) After finding the location of the heart impulse, calculate the RR interval and accumulate it with the previous RR interval, then calculate the number of accumulated RR intervals. 7) Continue serching until the end of the data, and calculate the global mean for the RR intervals together. Electrocardiograph 3.2 Find the start/suffix of each wave The start/end of the qrs complex has been approximated in the process of locating the cardiac impulses above, but mainly to help locate the cardiac impulses; In addition, locations are searched based on imprecise slope threshold values . Here, according to the location of the cardiac impulse found, the start/end of the QRS complex will be accurately searched. Name the location of the cardiac impulse as the peak of the R wave. 1. Read data 1) Read a single qrs-complex data: take the R-wave peak as a reference, search directly to the original ecg file, read a piece of data containing the qrs-complex. 2) Preprocessing: assigns the absolute slope value for the 12-lead signal. 3) Use the preprocessed data to perform a search for the QRS complex, P wave and T wave as follows. 4) Read the next qrs-complex data, repeat step 2 and step 3 until the qrs- complex analysis is complete. 2. Find the QRS complex 1) Calculate the S-wave threshold value: find the minimum value within 200 ms after the peak of the R-wave, take the same value as the minimum value plus 0.4, as the threshold value to find the end of the 2) Find the start of the Q-wave: take 0.5 as the threshold value, look ahead starting from the R-wave, the point less than the threshold value, within 0ms-200ms before the peak of the R-wave, which is the start of the Q-wave. 3) Find the end of the S-wave: look for a retreat starting from the R-wave, a point that is less than the threshold value of the end of the S-wave, within 0ms-200ms after the peak of the R-wave, which is the end of the S-wave. 3. Find the P-wave 1) P-wave crest: find the maximum value within 30ms-100ms before the start of the Q-wave, mark the point as a temporary P-wave crest. Electrocardiograph 2) Find the end of the P-wave: find the minimum value between the peaks of the P-wave, the minimum value plus 0.06 is the threshold value, use the threshold value to find the start of the P-wave. 3) If the found P wave is narrow, examine the P wave according to the following steps. 4) Change the search range from 30ms-100ms to 100ms-350ms in step 1, repeat steps 1-4. 5) If the P wave is found to be still narrow, it means that the P wave is absent. 4. Find the T-wave 1) T-wave peak: find the maximum value within 30ms-300ms after the end of the QRS complex, save it as a T-wave peak. 2) T wave start threshold value: look for the minimum value within 0 ms-100 ms after the end of the QRS complex, the minimum value plus 1/10 of the peak value of the T wave is the threshold for finding the start of the T-wave. 3) T-wave end threshold value: find the minimum value within 200 ms after the T-wave peak value, the minimum value plus 1/10 of the T-wave peak value is the threshold for finding the T-wave tip. 4) Find the start of the T wave: in the range between the minimal value in step 2 and the crest of the T wave, find a point that is less than the threshold value of the start of the T wave, that point is the start of the T-wave. 5) Find the tip of the T wave: in the range between the minimal value in step 3 and the crest of the T wave, find a point that is smaller than the threshold value of the T wave tip, that point is the end of the T-wave. 5. Explanation of equipotential segments In the QRS complex search, this algorithm adopts the slope superposition analysis method for all leads, therefore, equipotential segments before and after the QRS complex are partially included in the pints of the start and end of the QRS complex. This depends on the number of leads that contain equipotential segments. If there are Electrocardiograph more segments, the slope value will be smaller after superposition, making it difficult to satisfy the threshold condition, and only a small number of equipotential segments are calculated to the starting and ending points of the QRS complex. On the other hand, if there are fewer leads containing equipotential segments, most of the equipotential segments will count towards the start and end points of the QRS complex. However, equipotential segments before and after the QRS complex are partly included in the duration of the QRS 3.3 Amplitude Measurement After finding the position of each wave, such as the start and end points of the P wave, QRS complex and T wave, use the method to measure the P, Q, R, S, ST, and T waves in each lead. 1. P Gelombang wave Calculate the average value from the data 20ms before the start point of the P wave, and use this average value as the basis for the P wave. Find the maximum value between the start and end points of the P wave, the difference between this maximum and base being the amplitude of the P wave. 2. Q/R/S Gelombang wave Calculate the mean value of the data 10-30ms before the starting point of the QRS complex, and use this average value as the basis for the QRS complex. Find a boundary point that extends beyond the baseline from the start point of wave Q to the end point of wave S. Every two adjacent boundary points create a sub-wave. Determine what is the minimum recognizable subwave (see explanation below). If the minimum wave can be recognized, first identify its direction. If it is above the bottom of the QRS complex, it is an R wave, if below it is a Q or S wave. Find the extreme value of this wave, and the difference between the extreme value and the base value is the amplitude of the Q/R/S wave. Note: if there is only one downward wave, its amplitude must be recorded in terms of the amplitude of the Q wave and the S wave, respectively. Electrocardiograph 3. ST segment Take above the QRS complex baseline as the ST baseline. Calculate the difference between the baseline St and the points at 40ms and 60ms after the endpoint of the QRS complex, and calculate the mean value of the two differences, the mean value being the amplitude of the ST segment. 4. T Gelombang wave Calculate the average value from the data 20-50ms after the end point of the T wave, and average that value with the QRS complex base value in 2, then use the result as the T wave base value. Find the maximum value between the start and end points of the T wave , the difference between the maximum value and the base value will be the amplitude of the T wave. 5. Minimum wave recognition The minimum waveform that can be identified by an algorithm according to the requirements of IEC6060-1-25-51:2003: Medical Electronic Equipment – Part 2-51: Specific requirements for safety, including critical performance, recording and analysis of single channel and multichannel electrocardiograph, Appendix GG , Clause GG.5 Definition of wave, measurement of minimum wave. The wave that will meet these conditions is the minimum wave that will be recognized by the algorithm. 1) One section under consideration clearly shows two opposite slopes with at least one turning point between them; 2) One section considered deviates at least 30 V from the reference level for a duration of at least 6ms; 3) The minimum observable duration of the wave under consideration is 12ms and the amplitude is 30 V. 3.4 Calculation after determination of interval The following parameters are determined in accordance with the requirements of IEC 60601-2-51:2003 Medical electrical equipment - part 2- 51: Special requirements for safety, including essential performance, recording and analysis of single-channel and multi-channel electrocardiographs, Annex GG Definitions and rules for ELECTROCARDIOGRAM measurements.

Introduction to CTS The CTS computerized ECG conformance testing project was launched in 1989 by the European Union. This project laid the foundation for a computerized ECG conformance testing service. At present, about 20 types of waveforms have been designed which are derived from test signals of infinite length, these signals are part of the CTS-EKG test database, and have been proven to be effective in a series of official tests. According to the requirements of IEC 60601-2-51:2003 Medical electrical equipment - part 2-51: Special requirements for safety, including essential performance, recording and analysis of single-channel and multi-channel electrocardiographs Clause 50.101.1, 13 data (CAL05000 CAL10000 CAL15000 CAL20000 CAL20002 CAL20100 CAL20110 CAL201160 CAL20200 CAL20210 CAL20260 CAL20500 CAL30000) is used for the automatic verification parameters for this test. Electrocardiograph 4.3. Introduction to CSE The EU CSE (General Standard for Quantitative Electrocardiography) ECG database contains a 3-lead measurement database from collection1 and collection2, a 12-lead measurement database for collection3 and collection4, and a collection diagnostic database5. Wherein, the 12-lead measurement database contains 250 groups of interference data; The diagnostic database contains 1220 cases of short-term ECG recordings. The main development goal of using 12 leads or 15 leads was to evaluate the performance of an automated ECG analyzer. In addition to normal data, the database also includes clinically confirmed ECG of various cases, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, any part of myocardial infarction and ventricular hypertrophy accompanying myocardial infarction.
