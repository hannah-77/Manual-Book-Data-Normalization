Physiological alarms Physiological alarms, also called patient status alarms, are triggered by a monitored parameter value that violates setup alarm limits or an abnormal patient condition. 2. Technical alarms Technical alarms, also called system status alarms, are triggered by a device malfunction or a patient data distortion due to improper operation or system Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm Alarm Levels In terms of severity, the oximeter’s alarms levels can be classified into three categories: high level alarms, medium level alarms and low level alarms. 1. High level alarms Indicate that the patient is in a life threatening situation and an emergency treatment is demanded. 2. Medium level alarms The patient’s vital signs appear abnormal or the oximeter system status appears abnormal, indicate that prompt operator response is required. 3. Low level alarms The patient’s vital signs appear abnormal or the oximeter system status appears abnormal, indicate that operator awareness is required. The levels for both technical alarms and physiological alarms are predefined and can not be changed by the user. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm Alarm Categories Table Medium Low Level Level Alarm Alarm SpO Temp Too Physiological Too Low High alarm PR Too Temp Too SpO Sensor Unconnected Temp SpO Sensor Sensor off Abnormal Low Battery Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm Alarm Indicators When an alarm occurs, the oximeter will indicate it through the following indications:  Character flash  Alarm tone High level alarms: character flashes quickly and sounds triple + double + triple +double beep. Medium level alarms: character flashes slowly and sounds triple beep. Low level alarms: character display constantly and sounds a single beep. 4.2 Alarm Conditions 4.2.1 Alarm Off Before the First Measurement Before the first measurement, the alarm system is configured to be off. At this time, if the SpO or Temp Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm sensor is unconnected or the sensor is off, the oximeter will not give an alarm. 4.2.2 Alarm for SpO Sensor Unconnected When the SpO sensor is disconnected, the oximeter gives a medium alarm. The icon displays in Information area. It displays --- in SpO , PR area of LCD, and gives a medium alarm. (Make sure Alarm System in menu is set to ON.) 4.2.3 Alarm for SpO Sensor off When the SpO sensor falls off the finger, the oximeter will give a medium alarm, and the icon displays in information Area. It displays --- in SpO , PR display area, and gives a medium alarm. (Make sure Alarm System in menu is ON.) Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm 4.2.4 Alarm for Low Battery When the battery is too low, the oximeter gives a medium alarm for low battery. After the low battery alarm occurs, the oximeter can still be operated for a few minutes before it turns off automatically. The low battery icon displays on LCD, and gives a medium alarm. (Make sure Alarm System in menu is set to ON.) 4.2.5 Higher than Hi Alarm Limit If the measured value is higher than the Hi Alarm (upper alarm limit), the oximeter gives a high alarm for SpO or PR, and gives a medium alarm for TEMP. Here we take PR for example: When the measured PR value is higher than the set PR Hi Alarm, the oximeter gives a high alarm (Make sure Alarm System in menu is set to ON). A ↑ icon displays near PR, which indicates that the measured value is higher than that of PR Hi Alarm, it will synchronously flash with PR value. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm 4.2.6 Lower than Lo Alarm limit If the measured value is lower than the Lo Alarm (lower alarm limit), the oximeter gives a high alarm for SpO , PR, and gives a medium alarm for TEMP. Here we take SpO for example: When the measured SpO value is lower than the set SpO Lo Alarm, the oximeter gives a low SpO alarm. (Make sure Alarm System in menu is set to ON.) A ↓ icon displays near SpO , which indicates the measured value is lower than that of SpO Lo Alarm, it will synchronously flash with SpO value. Likewise, when measured SpO is lower than SpO Lo Alarm, or measured Temp is lower than Temp Lo Alarm, it will also give an alarm. 4.2.7 Alarm Silence If Alarm System in menu is set to ON, pressing the Alarm Silence button, the audio alarm will be off for the pause period set by the user, but the visual alarm is still active. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm When the audio alarm is off, press Alarm Silence button to reactivate the audio alarm function. 4.2.8 Turning off Alarm System After Alarm system is turned off, the oximeter can not give a visual and an audio alarm except for low battery icon alarm. Set Alarm system to ON, the alarm system will be active. It will give an audio alarm and a visual alarm if an alarm occurs. 4.2.9 Alarm Priority Only one kind of alarm can be given at once. For example, if a medium alarm and a high alarm occur at the same time, the high alarm will take priority. 4.2.10 Alarm Delay There is a delay between a physiological event at the measurement site and the corresponding alarm at the monitor. This delay has two components: Handhled Pulse Oximeter Alarm 1. The time between the occurrence of the physiological event and when this event is represented by the displayed numerical values. This delay depends on the algorithmic processing time and the sensitivity setting. The lower the sensitivity configured, the longer the time needed until the numerical values reflect the physiological event. 2. The time between the displayed numerical values exceeding an alarm limit and the alarm indication on the monitor. This delay is the combination of the configured alarm delay time plus the general system delay time. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations 5 Performance Considerations 5.1 Performance Verification Qualified service personnel are responsible for performance verification procedures before the oximeter is used for the first time in a clinical setting. 5.2 Oximeter Performance Considerations There are some patient conditions that can affect the oximeter’s measurements.  Dysfunctional Hemoglobins Dysfunctional hemoglobins, such as carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and sulfhemoglobin, are unable to carry oxygen. SpO readings may appear normal; however, a patient may be hypoxic because less hemoglobin is Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations available to carry oxygen. Further assessment beyond pulse oximeter is recommended. Anemia causes decreased arterial oxygen content. Although SpO readings may appear normal, an anemic patient may be hypoxic. Correcting anemia can improve arterial oxygen content. The oximeter may fail to provide SpO if hemoglobin levels fall below 5 gm/dl.  Saturation The oximeter displays saturation level between 1% and  Pulse rate The oximeter displays pulse rate between 20 and 300 beats per minute (bpm). The sensor accuracy ranges do not apply to pulse rates above 300 bpm. Detected pulse rates less than 20 are shown as 0. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations  Temperature The oximeter normally displays temperature from 0℃ to + 50℃, there are abnormal state if the temperature is out of the range. It takes 5 minutes for the temperature measurement to stabilize. 5.3 SpO2 Sensor Performance Considerations Inaccurate measurements can be caused by:  Incorrect application of the SpO2 sensor.  Placement of the SpO2 sensor on an extremity with a blood pressure cuff, arterial catheter, or intravascular  Excessive patient activity.  Intravascular dyes, such as indocyanine green or methylene blue.  Externally applied coloring, such as nail polish or pigmented cream.  Failure to cover the SpO2 sensor site with opaque materials in high ambient light conditions. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations  Venous pulsation.  Dysfunctional hemoglobin.  Low perfusion. Loss-of-pulse signal occurs for the following reasons:  The SpO2 sensor is applied too tightly.  Defibrillation.  A blood pressure cuff is inflated on the same extremity as the one with the SpO2 sensor attached.  There is arterial occlusion proximal to the SpO2  Poor peripheral perfusion.  Loss of pulse/cardiac arrest. To use the SpO2 sensor:  Select an appropriate SpO2 sensor.  Apply the SpO2 sensor as directed, and observe all warnings and cautions presented in the SpO2 sensor user manual. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations  Clean and remove any substances, such as nail polish, from the application site.  Periodically check to ensure that the SpO2 sensor remains properly positioned on the patient. High ambient light sources that can interfere with the performance of the SpO2 sensor are:  Surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light  Bilirubin lamps.  Fluorescent lights.  Infrared heating lamps.  Direct sunlight. To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the SpO2 sensor is properly applied, and cover the SpO2 sensor site with opaque material. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations If interference due to patient activity presents a problem, try one or more of the following to correct the problem:  Verify that the SpO2 sensor is properly and securely  Move the SpO2 sensor to another site.  Use an adhesive to the SpO2 sensor.  Use a new the SpO2 sensor with fresh adhesive  Keep the patient still, if possible. If interference due to poor perfusion presents a problem, consider using the compatible sensor or the SpO2 sensor. The SpO2 sensor obtains measurements from the nasal septal anterior ethmoid artery, an artery supplied by the internal carotid. These SpO2 sensors may obtain measurements when peripheral perfusion is relatively poor. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations 5.4 Assessing the Validity of a SpO You can check the quality of the pleth wave and the stability of the SpO values to assess whether the sensor functions properly and whether the SpO readings are valid. Always use these two indications simultaneously to assess the validity of a SpO reading. Generally, the quality of the SpO pleth wave reflects the quality of the light signals obtained by the sensor. A wave of poor quality manifests a decline of the signal validity. On the other hand, the stability of the SpO values also reflects the signal quality. Different from varying SpO readings caused by physiological factors, unstable SpO readings are resulted from the sensor’s receiving signals with interference. The problems mentioned above may be caused by patient movement, wrong sensor placement or sensor malfunction. To obtain valid SpO readings, try to limit patient Handhled Pulse Oximeter Performance Considerations movement, check the placement of the sensor, measure another site or replace the sensor. The SpO accuracy has been validated in human studies against arterial blood sample reference measured with a CO- oximeter. Pulse oximeter measurements are statistically distributed, only about two-thirds of the measurements can be expected to fall within the specified accuracy compared to CO-oximeter measurements. The volunteer population in the studies composed of local healthy men and women from 15 days to 54 years, with various skin pigmentations.

Handhled Pulse Oximeter Maintenance Sterilization may cause damage to the equipment and is therefore not recommended for this pulse oximeter unless otherwise indicated in your hospital’s servicing schedule. Never use EtO or formaldehyde for disinfection. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation 7 Principles of Operation Fox Pro Pulse Oximeter adopts non-invasive double wavelength to measure SpO and PR. It can perform spot measuring and continuous measuring for a short time. It can also measure TEMP by a thermistor probe (a semiconductor whose resistance changes with temperature). The system consists of Central Processing Unit, Signal Collection, Signal Input, Data Output, Display and User Input module, as shown in figure 7-1: Figure 7-1 System Principle Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation The oximeter communicates with external devices through RS-232 interface. 7.1 Pulse Oximetry Measurement The oximeter uses oximetry to measure functional oxygen saturation in the blood. Pulse oximetry works by applying sensor to a pulsating arteriolar vascular bed, such as a finger or a toe. The sensor contains a dual light source and a photonic detector. Bone, tissue, pigmentation, and venous vessels normally absorb a constant amount of light over time. The arteriolar bed normally pulsates and absorbs variable amounts of light during the pulsations. The ratio of light absorbed is translated into a measurement of functional oxygen saturation (SpO ). Because a measurement of SpO is dependent upon light from the sensor, excessive ambient light can interfere with this measurement. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation Pulse oximetry is based on two principles:  Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ in their absorption of red and infrared light (spectrophotometry).  The volume of arterial blood in tissue (hence light absorption by the blood) changes during the pulse (plethysmography). The oximeter determines SpO by passing red and infrared light into an arteriolar bed and measuring changes in light absorption during the pulsatile cycle. Red and infrared low- voltage light-emitting diodes (LED) serve as light sources; a photonic diode serves as the photo detector. Because oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin differ in light absorption, the amount of red and infrared light absorbed by blood is related to hemoglobin oxygen saturation. To identify the oxygen saturation of arterial Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation hemoglobin, the oximeter uses the pulsatile nature of arterial flow. During systole, a new pulse of arterial blood enters the vascular bed, and blood volume and light absorption increase. During diastole, blood volume and light absorption reach their lowest point. The oximeter bases its SpO measurements on the difference between maximum and minimum absorption (measurements at systole and diastole). By doing so, it focuses on light absorption by pulsatile arterial blood, eliminating the effects of non-pulsatile absorbs such as tissue, bone and venous blood. Wavelength The SpO2 sensor contains LEDs that emit red light at a wavelength of approximately 660 nm and infrared light at a wavelength of approximately 900 nm. The total optical output power of the sensor LEDs is less Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation than 15 mW. This information may be useful to clinicians, such as those performing photodynamic therapy. 7.2 Functional Versus Fractional Saturation This oximeter measures functional saturation-oxygenated hemoglobin expressed as a percentage of the hemoglobin that can transport oxygen. It does not detect significant amounts of dysfunctional hemoglobin, such as carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin. In contrast, hemoximeter such as the IL482 report fractional saturation-oxygenated hemoglobin expressed as a percentage of all measured hemoglobin, including measured dysfunctional hemoglobins. Handhled Pulse Oximeter Principles of Operation To compare functional saturation measurements to those from an instrument that measures fractional saturation, fractional measurements must be converted as follows: 7.3 Measured Versus Calculated Saturation When saturation is calculated from a blood gas partial pressure of oxygen (PO ), the calculated value may differ from the SpO measurement of a pulse oximeter. This usually occurs because the calculated saturation was not appropriately corrected for the effects of variables that shift the relationship between PO and pH, temperature, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO ), 2,3-DPG, and fetal hemoglobin.
