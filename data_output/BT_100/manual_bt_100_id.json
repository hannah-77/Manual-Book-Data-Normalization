Product Principle 1.5.1. Principles of constant temperature and air convection circulation system The infant incubator is divided into two layers: the upper and the lower, and has openings at both ends lengthwise. Thus, it forms inside an upper-lower air convection circulation system. The lower layer is furnished with a centrifugal fan and electric heating tube while the upper layer with thermostatic cover and easily stretchable crib. Driven by the centrifugal fan, the heat circulates along a direction from upper to lower and from left to right so as to achieve temperature equilibrium. In the space of negative pressure of the centrifugal fan a square hole is made. The hole allows a little bit air outside the infant incubator into the incubator after filtered. The filtered air goes out through the outlet at the top of the organic glass thermostatic cover. It then forms a circulation with the air outside the incubator. Achieve the purpose that CO dosnot exceed standard. Under the crib is humidifying sponge. When the incubator is in use, the sponge fully absorbs distilled water. The electric heating tube evaporates the water in the sponge into air to form a convection circulation system, thus meeting the purpose of humidification. 1.5.2. Circuit Principle Design block diagram of main circuit Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 5 A. Power supply The equipment is externally fed by AC220/240V power supply, with DC 24V or 12V input, and internally equipped with a rechargeable lithium ion battery cell for short-time emergency use. The priority level of power supply source is AC220/240V--DC24V/DC12V -- DC12V, which can be converted by DC-DC (DC12-24V input, DC9V output) into working power supply DC9V for mainboard. To avoid the change of power supply mode causing vibration to power supply, a zero-clearance switching circuit made up of auxiliary Ni-MH battery (DC8.4V/0,17AH) is set up to structure a system power supply with power sense B. Control method of heaters As shown in the figure below, there are two modes of supply voltage: DC24V and DC12V, and thus two heaters are employed. The power supply is connected to the common terminal of the heaters by the normally open contact of the protective relay. When MCU detects the existence of DC24V, the MOS tube of K2 is used as temperature detect switch; and when MCU detects the existence of DC12V, the MOS tube of K1 is used as temperature detect switch. Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 6 C. Mainboard circuit The master control system’s core MCU employs STC single chip microcomputer, which features strong resistance to static electricity (ESD protection) and interference, high speed (as high as 80MHz) and high reliability. To allow the system to reduce working frequency in a steady way, it is set to be 11.05924MHz. Such working frequency can meet both our demand for speed and our requirement of system stability. The system adopts dynamic scanning display and keys scanning to meet MCU port amount. The temperature information, sampled by MCU and after data processing, is subject to digital display and relevant control respectively. The heating circuit shall be of DC12V/DC24 direct control, (or DC12V/DC24V PWM control). An independent temperature protection circuit shall be set up for over-temperature protection of the system.

If the power master switch is opened while the controller switch is closed, the incubator only has charging function work well, with other functions shut down. B. Fuse holder F 20AL250V refers to F-type fuse tube, 20A L 250V. When the fuse is damaged and needs to change, a screwdriver is used to screw down anticlockwise the fuse cover, thus to take down the fuse for renewal. Then it is screwed up clockwise. C. Power master switch While the incubator is connected to mains or an automotive electrical source and the power supply is normal, if the Power master switch and the controller switch both are opened, the incubator works well in whole (including display, heating, lighting, charging, etc.). If the Power master switch is closed the incubator will have no function work whether the controller switch is opened or If the Power master switch of the incubator is opened, while the automotive electrical source and battery supply are closed, the power interruption alarm will be activated. D. Mains socket Mains socket is a single phase triple socket. When connected to the equipment, make sure the ground wire of mains is grounded reliably. This Infant incubator Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 20 (transport) can use such two types of mains: AC 220/240V 50/60Hz E. Automotive electrical source socket This Infant incubator (transport) can use such two types of automotive electrical source: DC 12V and DC 24V. The locknut shall be locked after the power plug is inserted. It is required for reliable connection and firm locking. F. Lamp socket DC12V power supply is provided for supply to the lighting. G. Charger switch The charger switch is dedicated to charging up Infant incubator (transport) batteries. While the incubator is connected to mains or a car power and the Power master switch is opened, the charger switch is opened to charge up Infant incubator (transport) batteries. When the battery is being charged, the 4 level battery indicator lights will light up in turn and circulate repeatedly, and the charging indicator under the battery indicator light will be on. When charging is stopped, the 4 level battery indicator lights on the panel indicate the current battery level. (Note: there are a total of 4 battery level indicator lights, which indicate the current battery level in 5 grades, that is, 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). The charging indicator under the battery indicator light will be off. When the Infant incubator (transport) is using the battery, the battery indicator lights on the panel indicate the battery level, providing basis for clients of deciding whether the charger switch needs to be opened to charge up the battery or not. Description of battery charge indicator: The charge indicator will be green when the charging switch is opened to charge up the battery. When the battery is fully charged, and the charging stops itself or the charging switch is closed, the charge indicator turn off. Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 21 4.2.3. Priority level of power supply source connection The Infant incubator (transport) adopts a total of 3 kind power supply modes: mains, automotive electrical source and battery. The priority of these 3 kind power supply modes is: mains, automotive electrical source and battery. That is to say, the system is able to automatically detect power supply systems. When the system detects the mains, it will automatically activate the mains; if there is no mains, when the system detects an automotive electrical source, it will activate the automotive electrical source; if the system detects neither mains nor automotive electrical source, but only battery, it will activate the battery for power supply. 4.2.4. Oxygen port, skin temperature sensor port Oxygen port A. Oxygen therapy port When the oxygen cylinder is equipped with an oxygen inhalator, one end of the oxygen therapy catheter is connected to the inhalator, and the other end to the oxygen port. The oxygen therapy catheter shall be inserted hard into the bottom of the port so as to ensure a good seal and avoid air leakage. For oxygen therapy, a calibrated oxygen analyzer shall be employed to test the oxygen concentration. The operation can be referred to oxygen analyzer manual and similar documents. Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 22 B. Skin temperature sensor port Skin temperature sensor port Used for Infant incubator (transport)s to insert skin temperature sensor. A check shall be given to the adapter of the skin temperature sensor to make sure it is clean before inserted. It shall be cleaned if there is dust so as to avoid alarm due to bad contact. C. Use skin temperature sensors correctly In skin temperature mode, when a skin temperature sensor is employed, be sure to ensure reliable contact between the sensor probe and the patient’s skin. If the patient is lying on his back, the probe shall be placed between the xiphoid and navel at the patient’s abdomen, avoiding the liver; if the patient is lying prone, the probe shall be placed on the patient’s back, preferably at the kidney; as for the patients lying on side, where to place the probe is subject to the attending doctor’s directions. Attention: 1. The probe of the skin temperature sensor cannot be used as rectal thermometer. 2. The skin temperature sensor must be disinfected before reused once an ill infant is transported. 3. Do not place the skin temperature sensor under the patients. Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 23 1. When the skin temperature mode is in use, be sure the skin temperature sensor’s probe is in reliable contact with the suitable part of the patient. If the probe separates from the patient, the temperature it measures is not the expected patient’s skin temperature, but maybe the air temperature or the mattress’s surface temperature. This, as a result, will cause the patient to absorb excessive heat or loose heat sharply, thus doing grievous harm to ill infants’ body. 2. The temperature measured by a skin temperature sensor is just the patient’s skin temperature, not the actual body temperature. Therefore, skin temperature sensors cannot be used as thermometer. The patients must regularly undergo measurement of body temperature by a thermometer to check if they have obvious signs of fever or hypothermia. 3. Do not cover the skin temperature sensor’s probe with articles such as rug and diaper, or the accuracy of the temperature measurement will be affected. 4.2.5. Difference of power master switch, controller switch and charging switch When a mains or an automotive electrical source is connected, opening the Power master switch is the prerequisite for this Infant incubator (transport) to work. When the Power master switch is opened, the Baby incubator (transport) cannot work normally before the controller switch is opened, including display, lighting, heating, etc. While the incubator is connected to a mains or a car power and the Power master switch is opened, if the battery needs to be charged, please open the charger switch. When the battery is fully charged, please close the charger switch timely to protect the battery and the incubator’s charger. If there is no infant to be transferred when the battery begins to be charged, clients Operating Manual Infant Incubator Transport BT-100 24 can close the controller switch for the purpose of energy saving and protection of heater and circuit board.
