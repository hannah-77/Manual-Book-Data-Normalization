Summary Jaundice is a common phenomenon in neonatal period, it is observed that over 90% newborn babies have jaundice in different degree. It can be a physiological phenomenon (called physiological jaundice) in neonatal period, or it can be an important symptom of many diseases in neonatal period (called pathological jaundice). This pathological jaundice can cause bilirubin brain illness (called kernicterus), it can cause brain damage of newborn baby, and results in early death and serious sequela, so we must take immediate and efficient measures to treat neonatal pathological jaundice. The effect of phototherapy treatment for neonatal high bilirubin blood illness has been approved by clinic, its principle is that bilirubin can absorb rays to have actinic isomerization, it makes the indirect bilirubin oxidize into one water-soluble product under the bluish green light (light-oxidation bilirubin). It fades yellow according to liver and gallbladder discharging out of body. The medical field recognizes that using phototherapy to treat neonatal pathological jaundice is a simple and effective method. Neonatal phototherapy unit are also called “infant phototherapy device” or “blue light lamp”. It is necessary medical equipment of neonatal medical department. 2. Symbols Power On Attention.
