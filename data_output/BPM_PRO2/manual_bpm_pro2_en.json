Blood Pressure Monitor 2.3 Notice Please use the machine in the following use environment and storage place, if it is stored or used outside the specified temperature and humidity range (storage environment: temperature -20℃ ~ +55℃, relative humidity no more than 95%; Operating environment: Temperature +5℃ ~ +40℃, relative humidity 10% - 95%), the system may not achieve the claimed performance specifications. Places that don't splash water Do not put in hot, humid, direct sunlight places, places with less dust, do not put in places containing salt and sulfur, etc. Place in a stable place where there is no tilt, vibration, impact (including handling), etc. Do not store chemicals where they are kept, and do not store them where they are likely to produce gas. Patients with anticoagulants or with blood clotting disorders may get blood clots in the cuff even if it is worn in the correct position during blood pressure measurements. If the cuff fails to inflate within two and a half minutes, instruct the patient to remove the cuff manually. Prolonged excessive inflation may lead to blood obstruction and make the patient feel uncomfortable. When there is a common arrhythmia, the device fails to meet the claimed performance requirements. Any blood pressure measurement is influenced by the subject's posture and his/her physical condition. If you move or speak while taking a measurement, your arms are not in the right position, the machine is not on the level, or the machine shakes. For accurate measurement, please keep your back straight and your sitting Blood Pressure Monitor posture correct. Please relax and stay quiet. In case of equipment failure, the error code will be displayed in the format of \"EC XX\", see the section on Common Failures for details. There should be no debris around the equipment, and the gap between the surrounding area and the wall should be greater than 0.1 m. For power-off operations, you can disconnect the adapter from the network power supply by disconnecting the plug. Please pay attention to safety during operation. Do not place the device where the disconnect device is difficult to operate. Ask a professional physician to explain the measured blood pressure value if necessary. The product is not intended for newborns. The blood pressure value measured by this device is equivalent to that measured by auscultation method, and its error conforms to the requirements specified in YY0667-2008.
