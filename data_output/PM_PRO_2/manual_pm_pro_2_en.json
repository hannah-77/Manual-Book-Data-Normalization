    "3.2 Overview": "16.1 Overview The EFM provides the sideStream method for CO monitoring. Respironics Sidestream CO module is used for sidestream measuring. The principle of CO measurement is primarily based on the fact that CO molecule can absorb 4.3μm infrared ray. Absorption intensity is proportional to CO concentration of patient sample, the CO concentration will compute according to the detecting CO absorption intensity of patient Sidestream measurement takes a sample of the respiratory gas with a constant sample flow from the patient’s airway and analyzes it with a CO sensor. You can measure sidestream CO using the monitor’s built-in CO measurement. Respiration rate is calculated by measuring the time interval between detected breaths. 16.2 CO Safety Information 1 Do not use the device in the environment with flammable anesthetic gas. 2 The device should be used by trained and qualified medical personnel authorized by the manufacturer. 3 Nitrous oxide, elevated levels of oxygen, helium, xenon, halogenated hydrocarbons, and barometric pressure can influence the CO measurement. 4 The monitor will be damaged if any pipeline from the CO module’s air tube /the air inlet /the air outlet is plugged by water or other materials. 5 The accuracy of the CO measurement will be affected by the following reasons: the airway was highly obstructed; the leakage of air way connection or quick variation of environment temperature. 6 Follow precautions for electrostatic discharge (ESD) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) to and from other equipment. 7 Do not place the sensor cables or tubing in any manner that may cause entanglement or strangulation. 8 When using mechanical ventilation, gas compensation should be well set. Inappropriate setting may cause incorrect measurement result. 9 Respironics module is not equipped with automatic air pressure compensation, before you start the CO measurement for the first time, you must set the correct altitude. Incorrect altitude settings can cause incorrect CO readings. 10 Leakage in the respiratory system or sampling system may result in a significant low display of the EtCO value. Always keep all components connected firmly and check for leaks according to standard clinical procedures. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring CO 11 The EtCO reading is not always closely related to the paCO value, especially in neonatal patients, and patients with pulmonary disease, with pulmonary embolism or inappropriate ventilation. 12 Don’t measure CO while nebulized medications are being delivered. 13 The CO module temporally stops measuring during zeroing. 14 Disconnect the water trap from the holder or set Work Mode to Standby when the module is not in use. Setting path: CO Setup > Work Mode > Standby. 1 After the low battery alarm appears, please do not start the CO measurement, or the monitor may turn off for the low capacity of battery. 2 For disposal of hospital waste such as accumulated fluids, calibration gases, sampled gases, where not otherwise specified, follow local regulations regarding disposal of hospital waste. 3 If the measurement or sensor fails, stop measurement before the qualified service personnel solves the problem. 4 The cumulative use time for the sampling line in a single patient should be less than ",

PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG Chapter 9 Monitoring ECG 9.1 Overview The electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical activity of the heart and displays it on the monitor as a waveform and a numeric. This chapter also tells you about arrhythmia monitoring and ST monitoring. 9.2 ECG Safety Information 1 Only use the ECG leads supplied by the manufacturer when using the monitor for ECG monitoring. 2 When connecting the cables and electrodes, make sure no conductive part is in contact with the ground. Verify that all ECG electrodes, including neutral electrodes, are securely attached to the patient but not the conductive part or ground. 3 Place the electrode carefully and ensure a good contact. Check every day whether there is skin irritation resulted from the ECG electrodes. If yes, replace electrodes every 24 hours or change their sites. 4 Store the electrodes in room temperature. Open the electrode package immediately prior to use. Never mix electrode types or brands. This may lead to problem due to impedance difference. When applying the electrodes, avoid bones close to skin, obvious layers of fat and major muscles. Muscle movement can result in electrical interference. Applying electrodes on major muscles, for example on muscles of thorax, may lead to erroneous arrhythmia alarm due to excessive muscle movement. 5 Check if the lead connection is correct before monitoring. If you unplug the ECG cable from the socket, the screen will display the error message “ECG LEAD OFF” and the audible alarm is activated. 6 If the ECG signal exceeds the measuring range, the monitor will indicates it by a message “ECG Signal Exceeded”. 7 In order to avoid being burnt, please keep the electrodes far away from the radio knife while using electrosurgical equipment. 8 When using Electrosurgery (ES) equipment, do not place an electrode near the grounding plate of the Electrosurgery device, otherwise there will be a great deal of interference with the ECG signal. 9 The electrodes should be made of the same metal materials. 10 ECG cables can be damaged when connected to a patient during defibrillation or using other high frequency equipment. Check cables for functionality before using them again. It is recommended to use defibrillator-proof ECG lead to avoid burn. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 11 According to AAMI specifications the peak of the synchronized defibrillator discharge should be delivered within 60 ms of the peak of the R wave. The synchronization pulse output on the patient monitors is delayed by a maximum of 35 ms from the R wave peak. Your biomedical engineer should verify that your ECG/Defibrillator combination does not exceed the recommended maximum delay of 60 ms. 12 Before outputting signals with ECG, check if the output is functioning normally. 13 ECG accessories are not suitable for DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION (Refer to IEC60601-1 for more information about the definition of DIRECT CARDIAC APPLICATION). 14 Line isolation monitor transients may resemble actual cardiac waveforms and thus inhibit heart rate alarms. When the electrode or lead is loose or fallen, the monitor is easily affected by the transient response of certain types of insulation monitors. The transient monitor signal produced by poor insulation of the line may be very similar to the actual heart waveform, which will prevent the monitor from prompting a heart rate alarm. In order to avoid this, user should check lead wires for damage and ensure good skin contact prior to and during use. Always use fresh electrodes and follow proper skin preparation techniques. 15 The monitor can only be used on one patient at a time. Monitoring more than one patient simultaneously may result in hazards to the patient. 16 Pacemaker Failure: During a complete cardiac block or when pacemaker is unable to pacing/capture, high P-wave (greater than 1/5 of the average height of the R-wave) may be incorrectly counted by the monitor, which leads to a missing asystole. 1 Interference from a non-grounded instrument near the patient and ESU interference can cause inaccuracy of the waveform. 2 IEC/EN60601-1-2 (protection against radiation is 3 v/m) specifies that the electrical field density exceeding 3 v/m may cause measurement error in various frequencies. It is accordingly suggested that do not use equipment generating electrical radiation near ECG/RESP monitoring devices. 3 The simultaneous use of cardiac pacemaker and other patient-connected equipment may cause safety hazard. 4 If the pacemaker signals are beyond the claimed range, the heart rate may be calculated incorrectly. 5 In the default settings of the monitor, the ECG waveforms are the first two waveforms from top in the waveform area. 6 For measurements in or near the heart we recommend connecting the monitor to the potential equalization system. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 7 For protecting environment, the used electrodes must be recycled or disposed of 9.3 ECG Display The figure below is for reference only. The symbol ① indicates lead name of display waveform: there are several options, such as I, II, III, aVR, aVF, aVL, V (for 5 Electrodes). If you want to change the lead, please refer to Section Selecting Calculation Lead. The symbol ② indicates Filter setting, there are six options: Monitor, Surgery, Diagnosis, Enhanced, Diagnosis 1, and Customized. If you want to change it, please refer to Section Changing the ECG Filter Setting. The symbol ③ indicates waveform gain: there are several options, such as X0.125, X0.25, X0.5, X1, X2, X4 and AUTO. If you want to change it, please refer to Section Changing the Size of the 9.3.1 Changing the Size of the ECG Wave If any of the displayed ECG waveform is too small or clipped, you can change the size of it on the screen. First select ECG Waveform Setup > ECG Gain, then select an appropriate factor from the pop-up box to adjust the ECG waveform. X0.125: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 1.25 mm; X0.25: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 2.5 mm; X0.5: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 5 mm; X1: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 10 mm; X2: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 20 mm; X4: make the size of 1 mV ECG waveform signal become 40 mm; AUTO let the monitor choose the optimal adjustment factor for all the ECG waves. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG The effect of ECG wave gain is subject to the size of the wave area. Whichever wave gain is chosen, the ECG wave has to be displayed within the wave area, the exceeded part is 9.3.2 Changing the ECG Filter Settings The ECG filter setting defines how ECG waves are smoothed. An abbreviation indicating the filter type is shown underneath the lead label on the monitor display. Filter settings do not affect ST measurement. To change the filter setting, in the ECG Setup menu, select Filter and then select the appropriate – Monitor: Use this mode under normal measurement conditions. – Surgery: The filter reduces interference to the signal. It should be used if the signal is distorted by high frequency or low frequency interference. High frequency interference usually results in large amplitude spikes making the ECG signal look irregular. Low frequency interference usually leads to a wandering or rough baseline. In the operating room, the Filter reduces artifacts and interference from electro-surgical units. Under normal measurement conditions, selecting Surgery may suppress the QRS complexes too much and thus interfere with the clinical evaluation of the ECG displayed on the monitor. – Diagnosis: Use when undistorted signal is required and its own characteristics can be maintained. The waveform filtered by the bandwidth of 0.05 Hz~150 Hz is displayed so that the actual changes such as R-wave notching or discrete elevation or depression of the ST segments are – Enhanced: It should be used if the signal is distorted by strong interference from high frequency or low frequency. If there is still obviously interference in the signals when select surgery filter mode, it is recommended to choose the enhanced mode. In this mode, QRS wave rhythm information is emphasized, its shape information cannot be considered as diagnostic criteria. Under normal measurement conditions, the selection of this mode may inhibit QRS wave group and interfere ECG analysis. – Diagnosis 1: To meet the filtering requirements of ST analysis, it is used when ST analysis is turned on or when ST analysis results are concerned. – Customized: User can set High-pass Filter and Low-pass Filter as needed. Cutoff frequency of High-pass can be selected as: 0.01 Hz, 0.05 Hz, 0.15 Hz, 0.25 Hz, 0.32 Hz, 0.5 Hz and 0.67 Hz. Cutoff frequency of Low-pass Filter can be selected as: 25 Hz, 35 Hz, 45 Hz, 75 Hz, 100 Hz, and 150 Hz. After High-pass filter and Low-pass Filter are set, the bandwidth range of high – pass bandwidth to low - pass bandwidth can be formed. 9.4 Selecting Calculation Lead To set the calculation lead, select ECG Setup > Calc. Lead, or on the Normal display interface, click on the calculation lead waveform area, select Calc. Lead from the popup interface to make the appropriate setting. For 3 Electrodes, II, I, and III are selectable; For 5 Electrodes, II, I, III, PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG aVR, aVL, aVF, and V are selectable; For 6 Electrodes, II, I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF and leads responding to Va and Vb are selectable; For 10 Electrodes, II, I, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are selectable. Normal QRS complex should be:  The normal QRS should be either completely above or below the baseline and it should not be biphasic. For paced patients, the QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of pace  The QRS should be tall and narrow.  The P-waves and the T-waves should be less than 0.2 mV. Make sure you have selected the best lead with the best waveform amplitude and highest signal-to-noise ratio. Choosing the best lead is important for heart beat test, heart beat classification and ventricular fibrillation detection. 9.5 Monitoring Procedure 9.5.1 Preparation The skin is a poor conductor of electricity; therefore preparation of the patient's skin is important to facilitate good electrode contact to skin.  Select sites with intact skin, without impairment of any kind.  Shave hair from sites, if necessary.  Wash sites thoroughly with soap and water. (Never use ether or pure alcohol, because this increases skin impedance).  Rub the skin briskly to increase capillary blood flow in the tissues and remove skin scurf and 9.5.2 Connecting ECG Cables 1. Attach clip or snap to electrodes prior to placement. 2. Put the electrodes on the patient. Before attaching, apply some conductive jelly on the electrodes if the electrodes are not electrolyte self-supplied. 3. Connect the electrode lead to the patient's cable. 4. Plug the patient cable into the ECG connector. To protect the monitor from damage during defibrillation, for accurate ECG information and to protect against noise and other interference, use only ECG electrodes and cables specified by the manufacturer. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.5.3 Selecting Electrode Type To change the electrode type, please: 1. Select the ECG parameter area, open the ECG Setup menu; 2. Set Electrode Type to 3 Electrodes, 5 Electrodes, 6 Electrodes or 10 Electrodes, or AUTO based on the lead used. 9.5.4 Installing Electrodes The following table gives the corresponding electrode names used in Europe and America respectively. (Electrode names are represented by R, L, F, N, C, C1-C6 in Europe, whose corresponding electrode names in America are RA, LA, LL, RL, V, V1-V6.)

PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 3 Electrodes Placement 5 Electrodes Placement Take the American standard for example; see the following figure: ■ RA placement: directly below the clavicle and near the right shoulder. ■ LA placement: directly below the clavicle and near the left shoulder. ■ RL placement: on the right hypogastrium. ■ LL placement: on the left hypogastrium. ■ V placement: on the chest, the position depends on your required electrode selection. 5 Electrodes Placement To ensure the patient safety, all electrodes must be attached to the patient. For 5 electrodes, attach the V electrode to one of the indicated positions as below: ■ V1 On the 4th intercostal space at the right sterna margin. ■ V2 On the 4th intercostal space at the left sterna margin. ■ V3 Midway between V2 and V4 electrodes. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG ■ V4 On the 5th intercostal space at the left clavicular line. ■ V5 On the left anterior axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. ■ V6 On the left middle axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. ■ V3R-V6R On the right side of the chest in positions corresponding to those on the left. ■ VE Over the xiphoid position. ■ V7 On the 5th intercostal space at the left posterior axillary line of back. ■ V7R On the 5th intercostal space at the right posterior axillary line of back. V-Electrode Placement for 5 Electrodes 6 Electrodes Placement For the placement of 6 electrodes, please use the position of 5 electrodes in the schematic diagram to remove the two thoracic leads. The two thoracic leads Va and Vb can be placed at any two positions from V1 to V6, as shown in the following thoracic leads. To ensure that the label is correct, the selected Va and Vb placements must be set simultaneously in ECG Setup. ■ V1 On the 4th intercostal space at the right sterna margin. ■ V2 On the 4th intercostal space at the left sterna margin. ■ V3 Midway between V2 and V4 electrodes. ■ V4 On the 5th intercostal space at the left clavicular line. ■ V5 On the left anterior axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. ■ V6 On the left middle axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. ■ V3R-V6R On the right side of the chest in positions corresponding to those on the left. ■ VE Over the xiphoid position. ■ V7 On the 5th intercostal space at the left posterior axillary line of back. ■ V7R On the 5th intercostal space at the right posterior axillary line of back. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG V-Electrode Placement for 6 Electrodes 10 Electrodes Placement Take the American standard for example; the 10 electrodes should be placed as follows: The limb electrodes are placed in the same position as the 3 electrodes placement. ■ RL placement: on the right hypogastrium. ■ V1: On the 4th intercostal space at the right sterna margin. ■ V2: On the 4th intercostal space at the left sterna margin. ■ V3: Midway between V2 and V4 electrodes. ■ V4: On the 5th intercostal space at the left clavicular line. ■ V5: On the left anterior axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. ■ V6: On the left middle axillary line, horizontal with V4 electrode. 10 Electrodes Placement PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG Recommended ECG Electrodes Placement for Surgical Patients When using Electrosurgery (ES) equipment, leads should be placed in a position in equal distance from Electrosurgery electrotome and the ES grounding plate to avoid cautery. Electrosurgery equipment wire and ECG cable must not be tangled up. Monitoring ECG leads are mainly used for monitoring the patient’s vital signs. When using the patient monitor with other electrosurgery equipment, it is advised to use the counteracting defibrillation ECG lead. The placement of the ECG leads will depend on the type of surgery that is being performed. For example, in an open chest surgery the electrodes may be placed laterally on the chest or on the back. In the operating room, artifacts may affect the ECG waveform due to the use of ES (Electrosurgery) equipment. To help reduce this you can place the electrodes on the right and left shoulders, the right and left sides near the abdomen, and the chest lead on the left side at mid-chest. Avoid placing the electrodes on the upper arms. Otherwise the ECG waveform will be too small. ECG cables can be damaged when connected to a patient during defibrillation or using other high frequency equipment. Check cables for functionality before using them again. It is recommended to use defibrillator-proof ECG lead to avoid burn. 1 If an ECG waveform is not accurate, while the electrodes are tightly attached, try to change the leads displayed on the screen. 2 Interference from a non-grounded instrument near the patient and ESU interference can cause inaccuracy of the waveform. 9.6 ECG Menu Setup 9.6.1 Setting Alarm Source To change the alarm source, please select ECG Setup > Alarm Source, then a pop-up box is displayed: HR: the monitor considers the HR as HR/PR alarm source; PR: the monitor considers the PR as HR/PR alarm source; AUTO: If the Alarm Source is set to AUTO, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the alarm source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on and at least one ECG lead can be measured without a technical condition. The monitor will automatically switch to PR as the alarm source if: PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG –a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and –a PR source is switched on and available. The monitor then uses the pulse rate from the measurement currently active as system pulse. While PR is the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are switched off. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as alarm source. 9.6.2 Setting Beat Source To change the beat source, select either ECG Setup > Beat Source or PR Setup > Beat Source. Select from the following options: HR: HR is HR/PR beat source; PR: PR is HR/PR beat source; AUTO: If the Beat Source is set to AUTO, the monitor will use HR as the beat source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on, and at least one ECG lead can be measured. The monitor will automatically switch to PR as the beat source if:  a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and  a PR source is switched on and available. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as beat source and the monitor gives a “Di” tone with a blinking heart displaying in the HR parameter box when one heartbeat is detected. While a pulse is detected, the monitor gives a “Da” tone. 9.6.3 Smart Lead Off When Smart LeadOff is set to On, if the current selected calculation lead can not detect ECG signal, the monitor automatically switches the corresponding lead as calculation lead, and switches the waveform display of calculation lead at the same time. When ECG electrode is re-connected, and the original calculation lead recover its signals, the monitor automatically switch to the original calculation lead. To change the smart lead off setting, select ECG Setup > Smart LeadOff, and select the desired 9.6.4 ECG Screen Layout It varies with Electrode Type. When Electrode Type is set to 3 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal, and it can display one ECG waveform on the main screen. When Electrode Type is set to 5 Electrodes or 6 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal, Full-Scr and Half-Scr. Select Normal to display two ECG waveforms on the main screen; select Full-Scr to display seven ECG waveforms which occupy the area of seven waveforms on the main screen, to display eight ECG waveforms which occupy the area of eight waveforms on the main screen; Select Half-Scr to display seven ECG waveforms on the screen, occupying the area of four waveforms. When Electrode Type is set to 10 Electrodes, Screen Layout can be set to Normal and 12 Leads. Select Normal to display two ECG waveforms on the main screen; select 12 Leads to PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG display 13 ECG waveforms. 1 If 3 Electrodes is selected in the ECG Setup menu, only Normal can be selected for Screen Layout in the sub-menu. 2 In 10 Electrodes display interface, the filter can only be set to Diagnosis. 3 If 6 Electrodes is selected in the ECG Setup menu, Va and Vb can be respectively set to either Lead V1 ~ V6, but cannot be set to the same lead, Va is Lead V2 by default, Vb is Lead V5 by default. 4 If AUTO is selected in the ECG Setup menu, when the electrodes connected to patient is reduced from 10 electrodes to 3/5/6 electrodes, user can click Update Electrode button to enable the monitor to perform lead off alarm according to actual electrodes. 5 If AUTO is selected in the ECG Setup menu, Va and Vb cannot be set when the monitor recognizes the 10 electrodes system automatically. Va is fixed as V1 and Vb is fixed as V2. 9.6.5 Setting Pace Status It is important to set the paced status correctly when you start monitoring ECG. To change the paced status in the ECG Setup menu, select Pace to switch between On or Off. When Pace is set - Pace Pulse Rejection is switched on. This means that pacemaker pulses are not counted as extra QRS complexes. - Paced symbol is displayed as | on the main screen. At this time, the artifact is displayed on the screen instead of the actual pacemaker crest. All pacemaker crests are the same, so do not give a diagnostic explanation about the size and shape of the pacemaker crest. When monitoring a patient with a pacemaker, set Pace to On. If monitoring a patient without a pacemaker, set Pace to Off. 1 Some pace pulses can be difficult to reject. When this happens, the pulses are counted as a QRS complex, and could result in an incorrect HR and failure to detect cardiac arrest or some arrhythmias. Be sure to check the paced symbol on the display screen has correctly detected the pacing pulse. Keep pacemaker patients under close observation. 2 For patients with pacemakers, the pace must be switched ON. Otherwise, the pacing impulse may be counted as regular QRS complexes, which could prevent an asystole event from being detected. When changing settings and admitting patients, please make sure the pace mode is always correct. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 3 External pacing electrodes: When using pacemakers with external pacing electrodes on the patient, the quality of arrhythmia is severely degraded due to the high energy level in the pacemaker pulse. This can cause arrhythmia algorithms cannot detect the pacemaker without capturing or asystole. 9.6.6 ECG Calibration This item is used to calibrate ECG waveform. When you select this item from ECG Setup menu again, the ECG waveform calibration ends. The patients can’t be monitored during ECG calibration. 9.6.7 ECG Waveform Settings To change the speed, select ECG Waveform Setup > Sweep, then select an appropriate setting from the pop-up list. The bigger the value is, the wider the waveform is. Select ECG Waveform Setup > Cascade: Turn on or off ECG cascade. Cascade means the ECG waveforms displayed on the screen all occupy the area of two waveforms. This function is valid only when Screen Layout is set to Normal. 9.7 12-Lead ECG Monitoring (Optional) In 12-lead display mode, 12 ECG waveforms and one rhythm lead waveform will be shown at the waveform area on the screen. The rhythm lead is for ECG calculation before entering 12-lead display mode. Also, in this mode, the filter mode is set to Diagnosis and cannot be changed. 1 The 12-lead analysis results are for reference only and the clinical significance must be determined by the physician. 2 If the ECG signal is too weak, the 12-lead analysis results might be affected. 3 Regarding to the standards' instructions for ECG measurement and analysis of the 4 For 12-lead analysis, the gain selection contains: 1.25 mm/mV (×0.125), 2.5 mm/mV (×0.25), 5 mm/mV (×0.5), 10 mm/mV (×1), AUTO gain. 5 As the 12-lead analysis system of the monitor is not exactly identical to the 12 conventional ECG leads obtained from an electrocardiograph, its measurement is for reference only and should not be used for diagnostic interpretations. 9.7.1 Activating 12-Lead ECG Monitoring Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups > Activate 6/10 Electrodes in order to get the SN number which is supposed to be supplied to the manufacturer for a PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG corresponding password. Enter the password on the above-mentioned interface and restart the monitor, and the 6/10 Electrodes ECG monitoring function will be activated. If the 6/10 Electrodes ECG monitoring fails to be activated, users can reenter the password and try to activate this function again. 9.7.2 Analysis Function If your monitor is configured with the 12-lead ECG monitoring function, the monitor can perform automatic analysis function. To perform 12-lead analysis: 1. In the ECG Setup menu, set Electrode Type to 10 Electrodes and set Screen Layout to 12 2. Select the shortcut key on the shortcut widget screen directly. 3. The analysis results will be provided in the Analysis Review window after approximately 10 The measurement function provides the automatic measurement of the common parameters, such as heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT/QTC interval, P/QRS/T axis, RV5/SV1 amplitude and RV5+SV1 amplitude. The interpretation function provides the automatic analysis of hundreds of abnormal cases, such as arrhythmia, AV block, IVCD (Intraventricular Conduction Block), myocardial infarction, ventricular hypertrophy and atrial enlargement, ST-T abnormality and electrical axis deviation. 9.7.3 Waveform Durations and Isoelectric Segments Between the global onset and offset of the QRS-complex, signal parts with a duration of more than 6 ms and amplitude not exceeding 20 μV should be defined as isoelectric segments. Because the duration of the Q-, R- or S-wave of 12 leads is respectively detected by the ECG algorithm, isoelectric parts (I-waves) after global QRS-onset or before global QRS-offset (K-wave) are excluded in the measurement duration of the respective adjacent waveform. QRS Duration = Rd+Sd+R’d R Duration S Duration PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.8 ST Segment Monitoring The monitor performs ST segment analysis on normal and atrially paced beats and calculates ST segment elevations and depressions. This information can be displayed in the form of ST numerics and ST templates on the monitor. ST segment monitoring function is shut off by default. You can switch it to On when necessary. When using the ST analysis function, the ST analysis results will be displayed on the right of the main screen. 1 ST-segment analysis is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for use with neonatal and pediatric patients. For this reason, the recommended and default setting for ST analysis in neonatal and pediatric modes is 2 In ST analysis, the obtained ST value and ST template are all unaffected by the selected filter mode. ST algorithm itself uses a dedicated linear filter to ensure the signal is not distorted, and to better ensure the consistent and accurate measurement value and ST template can be obtained in different filter modes. If the doctor wants to observe the waveform to evaluate ST segment result, it is recommended to use the ST template for observation, as it is not affected by the filter mode. If the real-time waveform displayed on the interface is used to evaluate ST segment result, it is recommended to select Diagnosis mode. 3 Reliable ST monitoring may be influenced in following situations:  You are unable to get a lead with low noise  If there is arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation/flutter, the ECG baseline may be irregular.  The patient is continually performing ventricular paced.  The patient cannot get the leading template for a long time.  The patient has left bundle branch block. When any of above situations happens, ST monitoring should be switched off. 4 The ST algorithm has been tested for accuracy of the ST segment data. The significance of the ST segment changes need to be determined by a clinician. 5 If you use ST analysis, you must adjust the ST measurement point when you start the monitor. If the patient's heart rate or ECG waveform changes significantly, this will affect the size of the QT interval, so the ST point must be placed. If the equipotential or ST points are not set correctly, the ST fragments of the artifacts may be depressed or raised. Always ensure that the ST measurement point is suitable for your patient. 6 ST values may be affected by such factors as some drugs or metabolic and conduction disturbances. 7 ST is calculated with a fixed delay from the R position. Changes in heart rate or the PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG width of QRS may affect ST. 8 If the algorithm triggers self-learning (either manually or automatically), the calculation of ST segment will be reinitialized. 9.8.1 Setting ST Analysis To change ST analysis, please select ECG Setup > ST Analysis, then select On or Off from the pop-up list. 9.8.2 ST Display Your monitor screen may be configured to look slightly different from the illustrations. 9.8.3 About ST Measurement Points The ST value for each beat complex is the vertical difference between the ISO point and the ST point, as shown in the diagram below. The isoelectric (ISO) point provides the baseline, and the ST point is at the midpoint of the ST segment. The J point is where the QRS complex changes its slope; as it is a fixed distance away from the ST point, it can be useful to help you position the ST point correctly. The ST and ISO measurement points need to be adjusted when you start monitoring, and if the patient's heart rate or ECG morphology changes significantly. Always ensure that ST measurement points are appropriate for your patient. Abnormal QRS complex is not considered in ST segment 9.8.4 Adjusting ST and ISO Measurement Points Depending on your monitor’s configuration, the ST point can be positioned, too. These two points can be adjusted by moving the cursor line. When adjusting ST measurement point, the system will show the ST Measurement Point Window. The system displays the QRS complex template in the window. It is adjustable for the highlight bar in the window. You may select ISO or ST, move the cursor line left or right. When the cursor is at the required position, PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG you may select the base point or the measurement point. 9.8.5 ST Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > ST Analysis > ST Alarm Setup to change the ST Alarm Mode: Real Time: The user can set the alarm switch, alarm level, alarm limit and alarm record separately for each ST or all ST. Differential: The monitor triggers the alarm according to the change of ST. The user does not need to set alarm for each ST separately, but only need to set alarm switch, alarm level and alarm difference value (-0.1~0.1) for all ST. When ST Alarm Mode is differential, the user needs to select Delay to set the ST alarm delay time. 3 seconds and 5 seconds are optional, and the default is 3 seconds. Besides, the Difference and baseline value shall be set, the difference range is 0.01 mv ~0.1 mv, and the baseline range is -1.90 mv ~1.90 mv. 9.8.6 ST View The ST View displays a complete QRS segment for each ST lead. The color of current ST segment and ST value are consistent with the color of HR. The color of baseline and ST value are yellow. To enter ST view, please select ST View in ST Analysis. In the ST View interface, the user can save ST baseline through clicking Save as Base when ST values gets stable. If no ST baseline is saved, the monitor automatically saves the baseline when the first valid and complete ST waveform appears. In the ST View interface, the user can display the current waveform, baseline waveform, or the both by selecting Real, Baseline or Real+Base. The user can also hide or display ST points by selecting Hide Points or Show Points. Besides, the user can record and print the ST view. In the ST View interface, the user can save ST segment through clicking Save ST SEG. Up to 20 groups of ST segments can be saved. When the 21st ST segment is saved, the earliest ST segment will be deleted. The ST baseline and ST segment will be cleared in following situations: 1) Turning off the monitor; 2) Changing the electrode type; 3) Changing the calculation lead in 3 electrodes; 4) Entering or exiting Demo mode; 5) Changing the patient type; 6) Admitting new patients; In order to view the ST value situation of each lead more intuitively, the user can enter into the ST Histogram. The horizontal axis shows the lead name while the vertical axis shows the ST value. And the bar graph is used to display the ST value result. The ST histogram refreshes with ST View synchronizely. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 9.9 Arrhythmia Monitoring 9.9.1 Arrhythmia Analysis The arrhythmia algorithm is used to monitor ECG of adult patients in clinics, and detect the changes of heart rate and ventricular rhythm, and also save arrhythmia events and generate alarm information. The arrhythmia analysis is not clinically validated for use with neonatal and pediatric patients. Arrhythmia algorithm can monitor paced and non-paced patients. Qualified personnel can use arrhythmia analysis to evaluate patient’s condition (such as heart rate, PVCs frequency, rhythm and ectopic beat) and decide the treatment. Besides detecting change of ECG, arrhythmia algorithm can also monitor patients and give proper alarm for arrhythmia. The monitor can support 2 configurations for ARR analysis, basic ARR or advanced ARR (also called Basic or Advanced). The default is advanced ARR. For configuration selection, please contact service personnel of the manufacturer. 1 Advanced ARR is not available in USA. 2 When PM PRO-2 (as sub-monitor) is connected to PM PRO-1, if PM PRO-2 supports advanced ARR, it will synchronize with PM PRO-1 monitor; if not, basic ARR will be 3 The measured PVCs and Pause/min will be displayed in main interface. Pause/min is only applicable to advanced ARR. 4 Advanced ARR is intended to be used with CMS 2.65 or above version.

The dominant rhythm of N, N, A, N, N, A, N, N, A, and the rhythm PAC Trigeminy number exceeds the number of threshold value that has been set. The signal amplitudes of I, II and III leads shall not exceed alarm Low threshold value that has been set. Voltage(Limb) PS: this alarm is available for 5, 6 or 10 electrodes only, not available for 3 electrodes. NOTE: Arrhythmia monitoring is intended for use with adult patients only and is not clinically validated for use with neonatal and pediatric patients. For this reason, the recommended setting for arrhythmia monitoring in neonatal and pediatric modes is Off. Selecting an ECG lead for Arrhythmia: In arrhythmia monitoring, it is important to select the appropriate lead. For non-paced patients, the guidelines are: - QRS should be tall and narrow (recommended amplitude > 0.5 mV) - R wave should be above or below the baseline (but not biphasic) - T wave should be smaller than 1/3 of the R wave height - P wave should be smaller than 1/5 of the R wave height. For paced patients, in addition to above guidelines, the pacemaker signal should also: - not wider than normal QRS - The QRS complexes should be at least twice the height of the pacing pulse - large enough to be detected, without repolarization signal PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG According to Standard ISO60601-2-27, the minimum detection level of the QRS complex is set to 0.15 mV, to prevent the detection of P-wave or baseline noise as QRS complexes. Adjusting ECG displayed waveform size (gain adjustment) won’t influence ECG signals which are used for arrhythmia analysis. If the ECG signal is too small, a false asystole alarm may occur. Aberrantly-Conducted Beats: As not recognizing the P waves, the monitoring system is difficult to distinguish between aberrantly-conducted beats and ventricular heartbeat. If the aberrantly-conducted beat is similar to ventricular tachycardia, it may be classified as ventricular. Make sure to select such a lead, the aberrantly-conducted beats have an R wave that is as narrow as possible to minimize the incorrect calls. The ventricular should have a different appearance from “normal heartbeat”. Physicians should be more alert to these patients. Intermittent bundle branch block: bundle branch block or other bundle obstruction phenomenon is a challenge for arrhythmia algorithm. If the QRS wave during the block has a considerable change in morphology compared to the normal QRS of learning, the blocked heartbeat may be misclassified as ventricular tachycardia, resulting in an incorrect chamber alarm. Make sure to select such a lead, which blocks the heartbeat of the R wave as narrow as possible to minimize the wrong classification. Ventricular heartbeat should have a different appearance from “normal heartbeat”. Physicians should be more alert to these patients. 1 Heart rate reading may be affected by cardiac arrhythmias. Do not rely entirely on heart rate alarms when monitoring patients with arrhythmia. Always keep these patients under close surveillance. 2 Since the arrhythmia detection algorithm sensitivity and specificity is less than 100%, sometimes there may be some false arrhythmias detected and also some true arrhythmia events may not be detected. This is especially true when the signal is 3 The ventricular HR mentioned above refers to:  In basic ARR, when the consecutive PVCs number ≥ 5, the algorithm calculates ventricular HR with the average of 4-8 RR intervals.  In advanced ARR, when the consecutive PVCs number ≥ 3, the algorithm calculates ventricular HR with the average of 2-8 RR intervals. The methods are different from the HR Averaging Method of the monitor. Therefore, the ventricular HR values calculated by basic/advanced ARR algorithm may be different from the HR values calculated by HR Averaging Method. The ventricular HR is for judging arrhythmias and is not exactly equal to the HR displayed on the interface. 4 The ARR analysis results and HR values obtained during ARR analysis and HR calculation are not affected by the selected filter mode. The algorithm itself has independent data-flow processing, which can better ensure the consistent and accurate results in different filter modes. 5 Atrial fibrillation alarm should meet below two conditions for 1 minute: PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG  The RR interval of normal beats must be irregular,  It can be seen that the obvious f or P waves do not exist. 6 Atrial fibrillation analysis is only applicable to adult patients and should not be performed for PVC or pacing fluctuations. 7 Atrial flutter cannot be detected by the atrial fibrillation algorithm because most of their RR intervals are regular. 8 In following situations, atrial fibrillation alarm detection error may occur:  Sinus arrhythmia  Atrioventricular block  Frequent ventricular premature beats  Myoelectric interference  Electrode motion artifact 9.9.2 ARR Analysis Menu 9.9.2.1 Switching ARR Analysis On and Off To switch ARR Analysis on or off, in the ECG Setup menu, select ARR Analysis to switch between On and Off from the popup interface. 9.9.2.2 ARR Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > ARR Analysis > ARR Alarm Setup to change the following ARR alarm  Separately switch on or off each arrhythmia alarm and set the alarm level.  Select All Alarms On/All Alarms Off to switch on or off all arrhythmia alarms except key ARR alarms.  Set the threshold of certain arrhythmia alarms. When an arrhythmia exceeds its threshold, an alarm will be triggered.  Select Default to restore the ARR alarm settings to factory defaults. Confirm the changes to make the settings effective. V-Fib/V-Tach, ExtremeTachy, ExtremeBrady, V-Tach and Vent Brady are key ARR alarms and they are preset to be on. The user can switch on/off those key ARR alarms only when Key ARR Alarm Switch Authority is enabled. To enable the authority, 1. Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain, and enter the required password. 2. Select Alarm Setup and set Key ARR Alarm Switch Authority to On. If any of key ARR alarms is switched off, the bottom information area will prompt Key ARR Alarm Off. Clicking the prompts can view the details. Asystole and Sustain VT alarms are preset to On and cannot be turned off. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG When the ARR alarm is set to Off, the monitor won’t give an alarm prompt even if an alarm occurs. In order to avoid endangering the patient’s life, the user should use this function cautiously. Pacer not Capture and Pacer not Pacing alarms are available only when Pace is set to 9.9.2.3 Adjustable Range of ARR Alarm Threshold ARR Alarm Range PVCs High 1/min to 99/min Pauses/min High 1/min to 20/min Pause 2 s, 2.5 s, 3 s Sustain VT 15 s to 45 s ExtremeTachy Adult: 120 bpm to 300 bpm; Pediatric/neonatal: 120 bpm to 350 bpm ExtremeBrady 15 bpm to 60 bpm PAC Bigeminy 3/min to 50/min PAC Trigeminy Low Voltage(Limb) 0.3 mV to 0.8 mV 9.9.2.4 ARR Selflearning Pick this item ARR Selflearn to start a learning procedure, and ECG ARR Learning is displayed on the screen. The ARR selflearning will start automatically in the following status:  Switching the ARR Analysis from Off to On;  Changing patient type or electrodes type;  Connecting or switching calculation leads;  Changing pacemaker status;  Exiting DEMO or Standby mode;  Admitting a patient;  Switching calibration mode into normal measurement mode;  Switching the ECG parameter on;  Changing-over between basic ARR and advanced ARR. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG 1 During the relearning phase of the algorithm, arrhythmia detection may not be available. So you should closely monitor the patient condition during and for several minutes after the learning phase to allow the algorithm to reach optimal detection performance. 2 Take care to initiate ARR selflearning only during periods of predominantly normal rhythm and when ECG signal is relatively noise-free. If ARR selflearning takes place during arrhythmia, the ectopics may be incorrectly learned as normal QRS complex. This may result in missed detection of subsequent events of arrhythmia. 3 If ARR selflearning is performed during ventricular rhythm, ventricular heartbeats may be erroneously identified as normal QRS complexes. This may lead to missed ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation events. Due to this reason, you should: 1) Take care that ARR selflearning may start automatically; 2) Response to lead off information; 3) Always check the correctness of arrhythmia alarm. 9.10 QT Analysis* *Not available in U.S.A. The QT interval is the time from the beginning of Q wave to the end of T wave. It measured the total duration of the depolarization (QRS duration) and repolarization (ST-T) phases of ventricular action potential. QT analysis can help detect extended QT interval syndrome. 9.10.1 Measurement Limitations The following clinical status of the patient may affect the QT analysis, and the inaccurate measurement may but is not limited to the following reasons:  The T-wave is very flat  Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation make T wave is difficult to define  The end of the T-wave is difficult to define because of the presence of U-waves  A high heart rate causes the P-wave to encroach on the end of the previous T-wave  Noise or the QRS wave variation is too big In these cases, the user should choose a lead with good T wave amplitude and no visible oscillations, and without a dominant U wave or P wave. In some conditions, such as left or right bundle branch block or cardiac hypertrophy causes broaden QRS complex. If long QTc is observed, verify it to ensure that it is not caused by QRS broadening. Since normal beats followed by ventricular beats are not included in the analysis, QT measurement could not be carried out when there was bigeminy rhythm. When the heart rate changes, it may take several minutes for the QT interval to stabilize. In order PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG to obtain reliable QTc calculations, it is important to avoid areas where the heart rate changes. QT/QTc measurements should always be validated by a qualified clinician. 9.10.2 Switching QT Analysis On and Off To switch QT Analysis on or off, in the ECG Setup menu, select QT Analysis to toggle between On and Off from the popup interface. 9.10.3 QT Display The following figure is QT display for your reference only. The graphics on your monitor may be slightly different. 9.10.4 Selecting QT Analysis Lead There are two modes for selection: All lead: Use all available leads (expect pressurized the limb lead) to produce an overall QT measurement, user can select ALL through ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Analysis Lead. Single lead: QT measurements were performed using all available single leads (except the pressurized limb lead). User selects any lead in Analysis Lead menu to enter into single lead mode. 9.10.5 Selecting Calculation Formula The monitor uses Bazett formula to correct QT values by default. There are four alternative formulas: Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham and Hodges. Hodges: QTc  QT  1.75  (HR  60) Bazett: QTc  QT   Fridericia: QTc  QT   QTc  QT  154  (1  ) Framingham: HR 9.10.6 Setting QT Baseline To quantitatively express the QTc values change, the user can set a QTc baseline, the baseline is used for calculating ΔQTc value. The user can set the baseline through ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Save Baseline, and the monitor displays The Baseline is saved at: (Time). If no baseline has been set, the first five minute QTc value after the QT measurement begins will be automatically PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG set as the baseline. If a new baseline is set, the previous baseline is discarded. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring ECG Because ΔQTc alarm is based on the difference of the baseline with the current values, inappropriate baseline settings may lead that no ΔQTc alarm is generated. The QT baseline will be cleared in following situations: 1) Turning off the monitor; 2) Changing the electrode type; 3) Changing the calculation lead in 3 electrodes; 4) Changing the patient type; 5) Admitting new patients; 6) Enters or exits Demo mode. If QT analysis is needed, please reset the baseline. 9.10.7 QTc Alarm Setup Select ECG Setup > QT Analysis > Alarm Setup to change the following QT alarm settings:  Separately switch on or off QTc alarm and ΔQTc alarm and set the alarm level.  Set the thresholds of QTc alarm and ΔQTc alarm. When QTc value or ΔQTc value exceeds the preset thresholds, an alarm will be triggered. 9.10.8 QT View To enter QT view, please select ECG Setup > QT Analysis > QT View. In the QT View interface, the color of current QT segment and QT value are consistent with the color of HR. The color of baseline and QT value are yellow. In the QT View interface, the user can save QT baseline through clicking Save as Base when QT values gets stable. If no QT baseline is saved, the monitor automatically saves the baseline when the first five minutes value appears. Besides, the user can record and print the QT view. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring RESP Chapter 10 Monitoring RESP 10.1 Overview The monitor measures respiration from the amount of thoracic impedance between two ECG electrodes. The change of impedance between the two electrodes, (due to the thoracic movement), produces a respiratory waveform on the screen. 10.2 RESP Safety Information 1 If you do not set the Hold High and Hold Low for the respiration correctly in manual detection mode, it may not be possible for the monitor to detect apnea. If you set the Hold High and Hold Low too low, the monitor is more likely to detect cardiac activity, and to falsely interpret cardiac activity as respiratory activity in the case of apnea. 2 Respiration measurements cannot detect all underexposure sudden events, nor can they distinguish between central, obstructive and mixed respiratory asphyxial events. It only prompts alarm in a predetermined time if the last breath is detected and the next breath is not detected, so it cannot be used for diagnostic purposes. 3 If operating under conditions according to the EMC Standard EN 60601-1-2 (Radiated Immunity 3 V/m), field strengths above 3 V/m may cause erroneous measurements at various frequencies. Therefore it is recommended to avoid the use of electrically radiating equipment in close proximity to the respiration measurement unit. 4 Cardiogenic artifact in impedance respiration monitoring may make it difficult to detect breaths or may otherwise be counted as breaths. In some instances, the breath rate may also correspond to the heart rate making it difficult to determine if the signal is due to breathing or the cardiac cycle. Do not rely on RESP monitoring as the sole method for detecting cessation of breathing. Follow hospital guidelines and best clinical practices for apnea detection including monitoring additional parameters that indicate the patient’s oxygenation status, such as EtCO and SpO . 5 For the diagnosis of apnea, especially in premature infants and infants, the safety and effectiveness of respiration measurements have not been validated. 6 To monitor the respiration, only non-ESU-proof accessories can be used. This is because the internal impedance of the ESU-proof accessories required to be used for electrosurgical operation is too large. 7 Some implantable pacemakers can adjust their triggering frequency according to the \"minute ventilation rate\". Impedance respiration measurements may cause these pacemakers to react incorrectly. To prevent this, turn off the respiration measurement. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring RESP 8 In manual detection mode, after changing the gain of the respiration wave, be sure to check the setting of hold high and hold low. 9 When ECG electrode is placed on patient’s limb, the impedance respiration may be unreliable. 10 Respiration measurement cannot be performed when ESU is used. The RESP monitoring is not recommended to be used on patients who are very active, as this can cause false alarms. 10.3 Electrode Placement for Monitoring RESP Correct patient skin preparation techniques for electrode placement are important for RESP measurement: you will find this information in the chapter on ECG. The RESP signal is always measured between two of the ECG electrodes. There are two standard ECG leads for selection: I lead (RA and LA) and II lead (RA and LL). Electrodes Placement for 5 Electrodes 10.4 Cardiac Overlay Cardiac activity that affects the RESP waveform is called cardiac overlay. It happens when the RESP electrodes pick up impedance changes caused by the rhythmic blood flow. Correct electrode placement can help to reduce cardiac overlay: avoid the liver area and the ventricles of the heart in the line between the respiratory electrodes. This is particularly important for neonates. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring RESP 10.5 Chest Expansion Some patients, especially neonates, expand their chests laterally. In these cases it is best to place the two respiratory electrodes in the right midaxillary and left lateral chest areas at the patient’s maximum point of breathing movement to optimize the respiratory wave. 10.6 Abdominal Breathing Some patients with restricted chest movement breathe mainly abdominally. In these cases, you may need to place the left leg electrode on the left abdomen at the point of maximum abdominal expansion to optimize the respiratory wave. Place the red and green electrodes diagonally to optimize the respiration waveform. Avoid the liver area and the ventricles of the heart in the line between the RESP electrodes so as to avoid cardiac overlay or artifacts from pulsating blood flow. This is particularly important for neonates. 10.7 Selecting RESP Lead To change RESP lead, in the RESP Setup menu, select RESP Lead to pick up the appropriate lead from the pop-up list. 10.8 Changing Hold Type To change the calculation mode, in the RESP Setup menu, set Hold Type to Manual or AUTO. When it is set to the AUTO mode, Hold High and Hold Low are unavailable, and the monitor can calculate the respiration rate automatically. When it is set to the Manual mode, you can adjust the broken lines in RESP area by the Hold High and Hold Low items. 10.9 Changing the Size and Speed of the Respiration Wave Select the RESP waveform area to open the RESP Waveform Setup menu:  Select AMP, and choose an appropriate value. The bigger the value is, the higher the waveform amplitude will be.  Select Sweep: select an appropriate setting from the pop-up list. 10.10 Changing the Apnea Alarm Time The apnea alarm is a high priority red alarm used to detect apneas. The apnea alarm delay time defines the time period between the point where the monitor cannot detect any respiration activity and the indication of the apnea alarm. Users should set it cautiously. 1. In the RESP Setup menu, select Apnea Alm. 2. Select the appropriate setting from the popup list. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO Chapter 11 Monitoring SpO 11.1 Overview SpO is used to measure arterial blood oxygen saturation, which is the percentage of oxyhemoglobin in the arterial blood. SpO parameter can also provide pulse rate (PR) and a plethysmogram wave (Pleth). 11.2 SpO Safety Information 1 Do not use the SpO sensors if the packaging or the sensor is damaged and return them to the vendor. 2 If the SpO sensor cannot work properly, please reconnect the sensor or change a 3 Correct and proper sensor application: if the sensor is too loose, it might compromise the optical alignment, and even cause the sensor to fall off. If the sensor is too tight, (such as the application site is too large or becomes too large due to edema), excessive pressure and local tissue ischemia, hypoxia and lack of nutrition may occur on the application site. Prolonged and continuous monitoring may increase the risk of Skin irritations or lacerations. To avoid these damages, users should periodically check surrounding skin of application site according to the patient's condition and pressure sensor, inspect the if there is sign of stress-related damage in surrounding tissue, and regularly change the application site. For the patients whose fluid is easy to transfer and/or the patients with systemic or localized edema, users should inspect the skin and change application site more frequently. 4 Use only sensors and extension cables permitted by the manufacturer with the monitor. Other sensors or extension cables may cause improper monitor performance and/or minor personal injury. 5 High oxygen levels may predispose a premature infant to retrolental fibroplasia. If this is a consideration do NOT set the high alarm limit to 100%, which is equivalent to switching the high limit alarm off. 6 When serious arrhythmia is present, the SpO pulse rate may differ from ECG heart rate but this does not indicate an inaccurate PR (SpO ) value. 7 Misapplied sensor or sensor that becomes partially dislodged may cause either over or under reading of actual arterial oxygen saturation. 1 Avoid placing the sensor on extremities with an arterial catheter, intravascular venous infusion line, or inflated NIBP cuff. When measuring SpO on the limb with inflated NIBP cuff, please turn on the NIBP Simul function. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO 2 When a trend toward patient deoxygenation is indicated, analyze the blood samples with a laboratory co-oximeter to completely understand the patient’s condition. 3 If the surrounding temperature increases, the operator should pay attention to the site of poor perfusion, and increase the frequency of checking the skin and changing the measurement site to prevent burns. If the initial skin temperature is less than 35°C, the temperature of all the listed sensors on the skin will not exceed 41°C during working. 4 SpO waveform is not directly proportional to the pulse volume. 5 The device is calibrated to display functional oxygen saturation. 6 A Functional tester or simulator cannot be used to assess the SpO accuracy. However, it can be used to demonstrate that a particular monitor reproduces a calibration curve that has been independently demonstrated to meet a particular 7 The cumulative use time for the SpO sensor in a single patient should be less than 30 11.3 Measuring SpO 1. Select the correct patient category setting (adult/pediatric and neonatal), as this is used to optimize the calculation of the SpO and pulse numerics. 2. During measurement, ensure that the application site: – has a pulsatile flow, ideally with a good circulation perfusion. – has not changed in its thickness, causing an improper fit of the sensor. Measurement Procedure 1. Switch on the monitor. 2. Attach the sensor to the appropriate site of the patient. Before Applying the Sensor: Be sure to understand all warnings listed in the previous section before applying any sensor to a patient. Also,check the sensor as follows:  Check the sensor outside and inside. To inspect the inside, gently open the sensor cavity and check splits on or next to the transparent silicone that covers the optical elements.  Any sensor showing signs of damage or alteration must not be used for further patient monitoring; instead, dispose of it using proper disposal procedures. Applying Finger/Soft-tip Sensors:  Nip the clamp, and choose a site that is well perfused and restricts a conscious patient’s movements least. The right finger of the non-dominate hand is preferred. Alternatively, the other digits on the non-dominate hand may be used. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO  The grate toe or long toe (next to the grate toe) may be used on restrained patients or patients whose hands are unavailable.  Place the finger into the sensor according to the direction of the symbol on the sensor. The fleshiest part of digit should be covering the detector window.  Orient the sensor so that the cable will be running towards the top of the patient’s hand.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). Applying Neonatal Finger (or Toe) Wrap Sensors:  When you perform the measurement, position the sensor over the hand or foot with optical components opposite each other.  Hold the sensor, and insert stretched strap into slot, hold it there while threading end through latch. If strap is too long, thread it through second latch.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). Applying Adult/Pediatric Ear Clip Sensor:  When you perform the measurement, clip the plastic fixing mechanism on top of the ear; make the ear afford the sensor’s weight to avoid the sensor getting loose.  Clip the probe onto fleshy part of the lobe with optical components opposite to each other.  Connect the sensor with the monitor (or with the extension cable if needed). 3. Plug the connector of the sensor extension cable into the SpO socket. Inspect the application site every two to three hours to ensure skin quality and correct optical alignment. If the skin quality changes, move the sensor to another site. Change the application site at least every four hours. For neonate, change the measuring site every 20 minutes. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO 1 Injected dyes such as methylene blue or intravascular dyshemoglobins such as methemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin may lead to inaccurate measurements. 2 Inspect the sensor to ensure that the light emitter and receiver are aligned with each other and there is no gap between the sensor and the finger. All the light emitted by the light emitter must pass through the patient's tissue. The sensor cable should be placed on the back of the hand. 3 Clean and remove any substances such as nail polish from the application site. Periodically check to ensure that the sensor remains properly positioned on the 11.4 Measurement Limitations Certain patient conditions can affect the measurements or cause the loss of the pulse signal. Inaccurate measurements can be caused but not limited by:  incorrect sensor application  high levels of ambient light sources, such as surgical lights (especially those with a xenon light source), bilirubin lamps, fluorescent lights, infrared heating lamps, and direct sunlight  failure to cover the sensor with opaque material in high levels of ambient light conditions  dysfunctional hemoglobins  low peripheral perfusion  excessive or violent patient movement  venous pulsations  intravascular dyes, such as indocyanine green or methylene blue  externally applied coloring agents (nail polish, dye, pigmented cream)  defibrillation  placement of the sensor on an extremity with a blood pressure cuff, arterial catheter, or intravascular line  electromagnetic interference Loss of pulse signal can occur for the following reasons:  the sensor is applied too tightly  a blood pressure cuff is inflated on the same extremity as the one with the sensor attached  there is arterial occlusion proximal to the sensor  low peripheral perfusion PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO 1 To prevent interference from ambient light, ensure that the sensor is properly applied, and cover the sensor site with opaque material. 2 Adjacent SpO sensors may interfere with each other (eg, multiple SpO measurements in the same patient). Be sure to cover the sensor with opaque material to reduce cross-interference. 3 Move the sensor to a less active site, and keep the patient still, if possible. 4 For Nellcor SpO module, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required for measuring SpO and PR depending on the measurement conditions. During normal measurement conditions the averaging time is 6 to 7 seconds. During conditions such as those caused by low perfusion, interference (e.g., external interference such as ambient light or patient movement), or a combination of these, the algorithm automatically extends the amount of data required beyond 7 seconds. If the resulting dynamic averaging time exceeds 20 seconds, the screen will display prompt message “SpO Search Pulse” and SpO and PR will continue to be updated every second. As these conditions extend, the amount of data required continues to increase. If the dynamic averaging time reaches 40 seconds, the screen will display high-level alarm message “SpO No Pulse” indicating a loss-of-pulse condition. 11.5 Assessing the Validity of a SpO Reading You can check the quality of the pleth wave and the stability of the SpO values to assess whether the sensor functions properly and whether the SpO readings are valid. Always use these two indications simultaneously to assess the validity of a SpO reading. Generally, the quality of the SpO pleth wave reflects the quality of the light signals obtained by the sensor. A wave of poor quality manifests a decline of the signal validity. On the other hand, the stability of the SpO values also reflects the signal quality. Different from varying SpO readings caused by physiological factors, unstable SpO readings are resulted from the sensor’s receiving signals with interference. The problems mentioned above may be caused by patient movement, wrong sensor placement or sensor malfunction. To obtain valid SpO readings, try to limit patient movement, check the placement of the sensor, measure another site or replace the sensor. 1 The SpO accuracy has been validated in controlled human studies against arterial blood sample reference measured with a CO-oximeter. SpO measurements are statistically distributed, only about two-thirds of the measurements can be expected to fall within the specified accuracy compared to CO-oximeter measurements. The volunteer population in the studies are composed of healthy men and women from age 19 to 37 (for ELITECH SpO module), from 18 to 50 (for Nellcor SpO module), with various skin pigmentations. Note that the study population was healthy adults and not in the actual intended use population. 2 The pulse rate accuracy is obtained by comparison to the pulse rate generated with PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO an arterial oxygen simulator (also an electronic pulse simulator). 3 During monitoring, if the monitor's reading differs significantly from the patient's physiological condition, it indicates that the signal may be disturbed, resulting in an inaccurate reading. In this case, the artifact can disguise as a similar reading, causing the monitor to fail to send an alarm. In order to ensure reliable monitoring, it is necessary to regularly check whether the sensor is wearing properly and the signal quality is good. 11.6 SpO Alarm Delay There is a delay between a physiological event at the measurement site and the corresponding alarm at the monitor. This delay has two components: 1. The time between the occurrence of the physiological event and when this event is represented by the displayed numerical values. This delay depends on the algorithmic processing time and the sensitivity. The lower the sensitivity configured, the longer the time needed until the numerical values reflect the physiological event. 2. The time between the displayed numerical values exceeding an alarm limit and the alarm indication on the monitor. This delay is the combination of the configured alarm delay time plus the general system delay time. 11.7 Perfusion Index (PI)* * Only applicable to the ELITECH SpO module PI is a numeric value indicating perfusion level. It reflects the perfusion level at the monitoring As the measurement of SpO is based on the pulsation caused by the blood flow through the vessel, PI is in relation to the strength of the pulse. Also, you can use PI as a signal quality indicator for the measurement of SpO . PI is indicated by a value ranging from 0 to 10. The bigger the value is, the better the perfusion and the signal quality will be. The perfusion level and the signal quality are at their maximum when the value reaches 10. When PI is below 2, it indicates the low perfusion and the poor signal quality at the monitoring site; you need to reposition the sensor or find a better site. The PI value will be displayed in the SpO parameter area. 11.8 Measuring SpO and NIBP Simultaneously While measuring SpO and NIBP on the same limb simultaneously, the user can set NIBP Simul to On in SpO Setup menu to lock the SpO alarm status until the NIBP measurement ends. If NIBP Simul is set to Off, low perfusion caused by NIBP measurement may lead to inaccurate SpO readings and therefore cause false physiological alarms. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO 11.9 Setting Pitch Tone If tone modulation is on, the PR sound lowers when the SpO level drops. In the SpO Setup menu, select pitch tone to switch between On and Off. 11.10 Setting Sensitivity The different sensitivity indicates different refresh frequency. High indicates the refresh frequency of SpO value is the most frequent. To change the sensitivity, please follow the steps: 1 Select the SpO Setup menu; 2 Select Sensitivity on the interface and select the desired sensitivity from the popup list. 11.11 SatSeconds Alarm Management* * Only applicable to the Nellcor SpO module. * Not applicable to MFM-CMS. 11.11.1 Describing SatSeconds With traditional alarm management, upper and lower alarm limits are set for monitoring oxygen saturation. During monitoring, as soon as an alarm limit is violated by as little as one percentage point, an alarm is immediately triggered. When the SpO level fluctuates near an alarm limit, the alarm is triggered each time the limit is violated. Such frequent alarms can be distracting. With the SatSeconds technique, upper and lower SpO alarm limits are set in the same way as traditional alarm management. However, you can also set a SatSeconds limit that allows monitoring of SpO below the selected lower alarm limit and above the selected upper alarm limit for a period of time before an alarm is triggered. The method of calculation is as follows: The number of percentage points that the SpO falls outside the alarm limit is multiplied by the number of seconds that the SpO level remains outside that limit. This can be stated as an equation: Points × Seconds = SatSeconds Points = SpO percentage points outside of the limit Seconds = number of seconds that SpO remains at that point outside of the limit The alarm response time, assuming a SatSeconds limit set at 50 and a lower alarm limit set at 90, is described and illustrated below. In this example, the SpO level drops to 88 (2 points below the limit) and remains there for a period of 2 seconds (2 points × 2 seconds = 4 SatSeconds). The SpO then drops to 86 for 3 seconds and then to 84 for 6 seconds. The resulting SatSeconds values are shown below: PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring SpO SpO Seconds SatSeconds 4 × 3 = 12 6 × 6 = 36 Total SatSeconds = 52 After approximately 10.7 seconds, a SatSeconds alarm will be triggered, because the limit of 50 SatSeconds has been exceeded. See arrow (↑) in the following figure. Alarm Response with SatSeconds Saturation levels may fluctuate rather than remaining steady for a period of several seconds. Often, the patient SpO may fluctuate above and below the alarm limit, re-entering the non-alarm range several times. During such fluctuation, the monitor integrates the number of SpO points, both positive and negative, until either the SatSeconds limit is reached, or the patient SpO returns within a normal range and remains there. 11.11.2 SatSeconds “Safety Net” The SatSeconds “Safety Net” is for patients whose saturation makes frequent excursions below or above the SpO limit but does not remain in violation long enough for the SatSeconds limit to be reached. If three or more SpO alarm limit violations occur within a 60-second period, an alarm will be triggered even if the SatSeconds limit has not been reached. 11.11.3 Setting SatSeconds Duration You can set SatSeconds to Off or to the duration among 10, 25, 50 and 100. To configure the SatSeconds settings, enter the SpO Setup menu and select the desired SatSeconds setting from the SatSeconds list.

You can obtain a pulse from any measured SpO signal or any arterial 12.2 Setting PR Source The monitor provides PR source options. You can select SpO or arterial pressure labels as the PR source in the PR Source list on the PR Setup menu. In the PR Source list, an arterial pressure label accompanied with a label with brackets indicates this label is in conflict. Do not select a conflicting label as the PR source. 12.3 Setting PR Volume Select PR Setup > PR Volume, then select the appropriate setting for the PR volume: five bars represent the maximum volume and one bar represents the minimum volume. If none of bars are selected, the PR volume will be off. Beat frequency of pulse has positive correlation with measurement value. 12.4 Selecting the Active Alarm Source In most cases, the HR and PR numerics are identical. In order to avoid simultaneous alarms on HR and PR, the monitor uses either ECG or PR as its active alarm source. To change the alarm source, select either ECG Setup > Alarm Source or PR Setup > Alarm Source, then select  HR: if you want HR to be the active alarm source.  PR: If you select PR as the active alarm source, the monitor will prompt you to confirm your choice. Be aware that if you select PR as the alarm source, ECG HR alarms are switched off.  AUTO: If the Alarm Source is set to Auto, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the alarm source whenever the ECG measurement is switched on and at least one ECG lead can be measured without a technical alarm condition. The monitor will automatically switch to PR for the alarm source if:  a valid ECG lead can no longer be measured and  a PR source is switched on and available. The monitor uses the pulse rate from the currently active measurement as system pulse. While PR is the alarm source, all arrhythmia and ECG HR alarms are switched off. If an ECG lead becomes available again, the monitor automatically uses HR as alarm source. Pulse alarms are only generated when the active alarm source is set to PR, a pulse source is set as system pulse and pulse alarms are switched on. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP Chapter 13 Monitoring NIBP 13.1 Overview This monitor uses the oscillometric method for measuring NIBP. It can be used for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients. It is also intended for use with pregnant, including pre-eclamptic patients. Oscillometric devices measure the amplitude of pressure changes in the occluding cuff as the cuff deflates from above systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks through the occlusion in the artery. As the cuff pressure decreases further, the pulsations increase in amplitude, reach a maximum (which approximates to the mean pressure), and then diminish. The blood pressure measurements determined with this device comply with the American National Standard for Electronic or Automated Sphygmomanometers (ISO 81060-2: 2013) in relation to mean error and standard deviation. In clinical investigation method with a reference sphygmomanometer, the fifth Korotkoff sound was used to determine adult diastolic pressure, and the fourth Korotkoff sound was used to determine pediatric diastolic pressure. The invasive blood pressure is used to determine the neonate pressure in clinical investigation, and the arterial reference sites include umbilical artery, arteria cruralis, axillary artery, brachial artery, dorsalis pedis, and radial artery. 13.2 NIBP Safety Information 1 Do not measure NIBP on patients with sickle-cell disease or any condition where skin damage has occurred or is expected. 2 Do not measure NIBP on the arm of the same side with a mastectomy. 3 Use clinical judgment to decide whether to perform frequent blood pressure measurements on patients with severe blood clotting disorders because of the risk of hematoma in the limb fitted with the cuff. 4 Do not apply the cuff to a limb that has an intravenous infusion or catheter in place. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when infusion is slowed or blocked during cuff inflation. 5 Do not attach the cuff to a limb being used for IV infusions as the cuff inflation can block the infusion, potentially causing harm to patient. 6 Do not apply the cuff to a limb where intravascular access or therapy, or an arterio- venous (A-V) shunt is present, otherwise, it may result in injury to the patient. 7 Ensure that the correct patient type is selected before performing measurements. Do not apply the higher adult inflation, overpressure limits and measurement duration for neonatal patients. Not using the neonate mode on a neonatal patient can block the blood flow, potentially causing harm to the patient. 8 Make sure that the air conduit connecting the blood pressure cuff and the monitor is neither blocked nor tangled. 9 Measuring of blood pressure can temporarily cause malfunctioning of other medical monitoring devices on the same limb. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 10 NIBP readings can be affected by the measurement site, the position of the patient, exercise, or the patient's physiologic conditions. 11 Continuous cuff pressure due to connection tubing kinking can block the blood flow, and may result in injury to the patient. 12 Verifying the calibration is only applicable for adults, and it cannot be operated in automatic measuring interval. Continuous measuring cannot be operated in automatic measuring interval either. 1 It is suggested that the user should not start NIBP measuring when the low battery displays, or the monitor may be turned off automatically. 2 If you spill liquid onto the equipment or accessories, particularly if there is a chance that it can get inside the tubing or the measurement device, contact your service personnel. 3 Continuous use of the automatic measuring mode for short intervals may lead to the discomfort of patient. Continuous measuring and automatic measuring in neonatal or pediatric mode may result in tissue damage or ischemia to the patient. 4 NIBP measurement can be affected by extremes of temperature, humidity and altitude. 5 NIBP measurement value should be explained by qualified professionals. 6 The pulse rate based on the NIBP measurement may differ from the heart rate based on the ECG waveform. NIBP measures the number of peripheral pulse pulsations, and the heart rate is measured by the electrical signal of the heart. When the electrical signals of the heart occasionally fail to cause the peripheral blood vessels to pulse or the patient's peripheral perfusion is poor, the difference happens. 7 The cumulative use time for the NIBP cuff in a single patient should be less than 30 13.3 Measurement Limitations Measurements are impossible with pulse rate extremes of less than 40 bpm or greater than 240 bpm, or if the patient is on a heart-lung machine. The measurement may be inaccurate or impossible in the following situations:  A regular arterial pressure pulse is hard to detect.  Patients with cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients with excessive and continuous movement such as shivering or convulsions.  Patients with rapid blood pressure changes.  Patients with severe shock or hypothermia that reduces blood flow to the peripheries. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP  Patients with obesity, where a thick layer of fat surrounding a limb dampens the oscillations coming from the artery.  Patients on an edematous extremity. 13.4 Measurement Methods There are four methods of measuring NIBP:  Manual - measurement on demand.  Auto - continually repeated measurements (between 1 and 480 minute adjustable interval). The interval can be user defined, and the default interval of user defined is 2.5 minutes. After the first measurement starts manually, the monitor will automatically measure NIBP as preset interval. When the measurement interval is set to 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 240 min and 480 min, the system will automatically adjust the next measurement time. Here’s an example. Auto Measurement Interval Current Time Next Measurement Time 5 min 12:02 12:05, 12:10, 12:15, 12:20, and so forth. 10 min 12:02 12:10, 12:20, 12:30, 12:40, and so forth. 15 min 12:02 12:15, 12:30, 12: 45, 13:00, and so forth. 30 min 12:02 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, and so forth. 60 min 12:02 13:00, 14:00, 15:00, 16:00, and so forth. 90 min 12:02 13:00, 14:30, 16:00, 17:30, and so forth. 120 min 12:02 13:00, 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, and so forth. 180 min 12:02 13:00, 16:00, 19:00, 22:00, and so forth. 240 min 12:02 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, and so forth. 360 min 12:02 13:00, 19:00, 1:00, 7:00, and so forth. 480 min 12:02 13:00, 21:00, 5:00, 13:00, and so forth. Note: When the completion time of manual measurement to the first hourly time is less than or equal to 30 seconds, the measurement will not be performed at the first hourly time, and the first automatic measurement will be delayed to the next hourly time.  Continuous- the measurement will run consecutively in five minutes, then the monitor enters manual mode.  Sequence- the measurement will preformed at needed phases as preset intervals, after the first measurement starts manually, the monitor will automatically measure NIBP as preset phase and interval. The phase can be selected as 4, 5 and 6. The interval can be set as 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 360 min, and 480 min. The user can also set the measurement times in each phase, there are several selections: Off, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, Continuous and Off. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurements in Auto mode may be associated with purpura, ischemia and neuropathy in the limb wearing the cuff. When monitoring a patient, examine the extremities of the limb frequently for normal color, warmth and sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop the blood pressure measurements. 13.5 Measurement Procedures To obtain accurate measurements, the following operating steps need to be observed: 1. Ensure the patient position in normal use, including:  Comfortably seated or lie flat, legs uncrossed;  Feet flat on the floor;  Back and arm supported;  middle of the cuff at the level of the right atrium of the heart;  Relax as much as possible, neither talking nor applying external pressure against the cuff. Rest for five minutes in a quiet environment. 2. Connect the air hose to the connector and switch on the monitor. Apply the blood pressure cuff to the patient's arm or leg and follow the instructions below. Cuff Usage - Ensure that the cuff is completely deflated. - Apply the appropriate size cuff to the patient (About the cuff size selection, please refer to Section NIBP Accessories), and make sure that the symbol \"Φ\" is over the artery. Ensure the middle of the cuff at the level of the right atrium of the heart that the cuff is not wrapped too tightly around the limb. Excessive tightness may cause discoloration and eventual ischemia of the extremity. Check whether the patient type is appropriately selected. Access the Patient Setup menu from Menu. Select the required patient Type in the Patient Info. menu. 3. Select a measurement mode and NIBP Unit (mmHg, kPa or cmH O, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa, 1 cmH O=1.36 mmHg) in the NIBP Setup menu. Refer to Section Operation Prompts for 4. Press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the shortcut widget PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP screen to start a measurement. 5. Wait until the first reading is taken. 1 The width of the cuff is either approximately 40% of the limb circumference or 2/3 of the upper arm length. The inflatable part of the cuff should be long enough to encircle 80%-100% of the limb. The wrong size of cuff can cause erroneous readings. If the cuff size is in question, use another cuff with suitable size to avoid errors. 2 If an NIBP measurement is suspect, repeat the measurement. If you are still uncertain about the reading, use another method to measure the blood pressure. 3 Please make sure the cuff is well connected. A leak of air may cause measurement 4 Please select the cuff with the suitable size. An unsuitable cuff may cause incorrect measurements. 5 Avoid incursion of liquid into the cuff. If this happens, please desiccate the cuff completely. 13.5.1 Operation Prompts 1. Manual Measurment Access the NIBP Setup menu and set the Measure Mode item to Manual. Then press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the shortcut widget screen to start a manual measurement. 2. Automatical Measurement Access the NIBP Setup menu and set the Measure Mode item to Auto, select time interval as need, then press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the shortcut widget screen. 3. Continuous measurement Access the NIBP Setup menu and pick the Continuous item to start a continuous measurement. The continuous measurement will last 5 minutes. 4. Sequence measurement Access the NIBP Setup menu and pick the Sequence item to start a sequence measurement. 5. Stopping continuous measurement During continuous measurement, press the button on the front panel or shortcut key on the screen at any time to stop measurement. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 13.5.2 Correcting the Measurement if Limb is not at Heart Level To correct the measurement if the limb is not at heart level to the displayed value: Add 0.75 mmHg (0.10 kPa) for each centimeter Deduct 0.75 mmHg (0.10 kPa) for each higher or centimeter lower or Add 1.9 mmHg (0.25 kPa) for each inch higher Deduct 1.9 mmHg (0.25 kPa) for each inch 13.6 NIBP Multi-Review Window To set the display of NIBP measurements, select NIBP Setup > Review:  When it is set to On, a window for NIBP measurements will be displayed at the waveform area on the main interface, and the size of this window varies depending on the numbers of displayed waveforms.  When it is set to Off, the window is unavailable on the screen. 13.7 Resetting NIBP When the pressure does not work properly and the system fails to give a message for the problem, pick Reset in the User Maintain > NIBP Maintain menu to activate self-test procedure, and thus restore the system from abnormal performance. 13.8 Calibrating NIBP NIBP is not user-calibrated. Cuff-pressure transducers must be verified and calibrated, if necessary, at least once every two years by a qualified service professional. See the Service Manual for details. 13.9 Leakage Test Leakage test is used to detect the air tightness of the NIBP pump, valve, and trachea. If not, the system will display NIBP leakage. NIBP leak detection should be performed at least once every two years or when you think the measurement is inaccurate. This pneumatic test other than being specified in the ISO 81060-1 standard is to be used by the user to simply determine whether there are air leaks in the NIBP airway. If at the end of the test the system gives the prompt that the NIBP airway has air leaks, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Procedure of Leakage Test 1. Connect the cuff securely with the socket for NIBP air hole. 2. Wrap the cuff around the cylinder of an appropriate size, don’t wrap the cuff around limbs. 3. Make sure the patient type has been set to Adult. 4. Access User Maintain > NIBP Maintain. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 5. Select Leakage Test. Then the prompt Leak. Test Running will appear indicating that the system has started performing leak test. For ELITECH module: The system will automatically inflate the pneumatic system to about 180 mmHg. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, if system leakage has detected, the system will automatically open the deflating valve to stop the leak test and indicates NIBP Leak. If no system leakage is detected when the pneumatic system is inflated to 180 mmHg, the system will perform a deflation to an approximate value of 40 mmHg and subsequently perform the second phase leak test. After 20 seconds to 40 seconds, the system will automatically open the deflating valve and provide corresponding indication based on the test result. For SunTech Module: When applying high pressures; take special care to increase the pressure at a rate that will not cause unwanted overpressure errors (300 mmHg). Manually inflate the pneumatic system to approximately 250 mmHg. Start the timer and wait 60 seconds for the pneumatic system to reach its pressure equilibrium point. After the waiting period, record the pneumatic pressure level (P1) and wait another 60 seconds and record the pneumatic pressure level again (P2). Safety circuitry on the module only allows the pressure in the pneumatic system to remain above 10 mmHg for 180 seconds. When this safety time limit is exceeded, the valves will open releasing the pressure. Subtract P2 from P1 and this is the leak rate per minute. 6. If the alarm information NIBP Leak appears, it indicates that the airway may have air leaks. In this case, the user should check for loose connection. After confirming secure connections, the user should re-perform the pneumatic test. If the failure prompt still appears, please contact the manufacturer for repair. Diagram of NIBP Air Leakage Test 13.10 Setting Inflation Mode To change the inflation mode: 1 Select NIBP Setup > Inflation Mode; 2 Choose Manual or AUTO from the pull-down list.  If Manual is chosen, the preset value by users will be adopted as the inflation value when measuring blood pressure.  If AUTO is chosen, the default value will be adopted as the inflation value when measuring blood pressure. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring NIBP 13.11 Cleaning Mode The cleaning mode can remove the dust and foreign matters in the air valve to ensure the accuracy of NIBP measurement. To start the cleaning mode, please select User Maintain > NIBP Maintain > Cleaning Mode, the monitor displays: Be sure the cuff is disconnected from monitor, after confirmation and clicking Start Cleaning button, cleaning mode starts. The cleaning mode lasts three minutes. In this mode, the monitor displays Cleaning in progress, the remaining time of cleaning mode and cuff value are also displayed. When the counting down finishes, the monitor exits cleaning mode automatically, if the user needs to exit the cleaning mode in advance, please click Stop button. When the air pressure is abnormal, the monitor will automatically turn off the cleaning mode and display the prompt message: Cleaning failed. Cleaning mode is only available when the patient type is adult. 13.12 Assisting Venipuncture The user can use the NIBP cuff to cause a pressure close to diastolic pressure, so as to block the venous blood vessel and therefore help venipuncture. To assist venipuncture: 1. Select NIBP Setup > Venipuncture; 2. Select the appropriate Cuff Pressure according to the patient type; 3. Select Start, the monitor displays: Venipuncture Starting. 4. Wait until the monitor prompts In venipuncture process. If an abnormal alarm occurs before it, no follow-up operation can be carried out. Restart the procedure after checking if necessary; 5. Puncture vein and draw blood sample; 6. Select Stop to deflate the cuff. If you do not deflate the cuff, the cuff automatically deflates when the venipuncture time expires (170 seconds for adult and pediatric patient, 85 seconds for neonatal patient). During venipuncture, pay attention to the cuff pressure and the countdown displayed in the NIBP numerics area. When the remaining time is 30 seconds, the monitor issues a reminder tone and the countdown displays in red, prompting the user that the venipuncture time is to expire. 1 Only when the monitor exits Venipuncture menu, the user can do other operations. 2 When the monitor is in DEMO mode, continuous measurement process, manual measurement process, sequence measurement process or auto measurement process, Assisting Venipuncture function is not available. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring TEMP Chapter 14 Monitoring TEMP 14.1 Overview Body temperature is measured by means of a thermistor probe (a semiconductor whose resistance changes with temperature) that is applied to the skin or to the rectum. Two TEMP probes can be used simultaneously to measure two TEMP values, and get the temperature difference. The standard configuration is skin probe for adult. 14.2 TEMP Safety Information 1 Verify probe cables fault detection before the beginning of monitoring phase. Unplug the temperature probe cable of the channe1 from the socket, and then the screen will display the error message TEMP T1 Sensor Off and the audible alarm is activated. It is the same to the other channel. 2 Take the TEMP probe and cable carefully. When they are not in use, you should coil up the probe and cable into a loose circle. If the wire inside the cable is tensely pulled, it may cause mechanical damage to the probe and the cable. 3 Temperature probes do not need any probe cover; please remember to disinfect the probe after each use on a patient. 1 The reference body site temperature is the same as the temperature of the measuring site. 2 The cumulative use time for the oral or rectal temperature probe in a single patient should be less than 24 hours. 14.3 Selecting TEMP Sensor Type The user can choose the TEMP sensor type as the temperature signal source. To configure the TEMP sensor type, select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups, and set TEMP Sensor to YSI-10K or YSI-2.252K. 14.4 Switching T1/T2 On/Off In Menu > System Setup > Module Switch, T1 or T2 can be switched on/off separately and won’t be affected by each other. 14.5 TEMP Monitoring Setup  With a reusable TEMP probe you can plug the probe directly into the TEMP connector.  Apply the TEMP probes securely to the patient.  Switch on the monitor.

The difference is labeled TD. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP Chapter 15 Monitoring IBP 15.1 Overview IBP is measured by means of a catheter inserted directly into the circulatory system. A pressure transducer connected to the catheter converts the mechanical force exerted by the blood into an electrical signal, which is displayed graphically as pressure versus time on a monitor screen or numerically on digital display. The monitor measures direct blood pressure of one selected blood vessel through a maximum of two channels, and displays waveforms and pressure of measured direct blood pressure (SYS, DIA 15.2 IBP Safety Information 1 The operator should avoid contact with the conductive parts of the appurtenance when it is connected or applied. 2 When the monitor is used with HF surgical equipment, the transducer and the cables must be avoided from conductive connection to the HF equipment. This is to protect against burns to the patient. 3 Disposable IBP transducer or domes should not be reused. 4 If any kind of liquid, other than solution to be infused in pressure line or transducer, is splashed on the equipment or its accessories, or enters the transducer or the monitor, contact the Hospital Service Center immediately. 5 All invasive procedures have risks to the patient. Use aseptic technique and follow catheter manufacturer's instructions. 6 Mechanical shock to the invasive blood pressure transducer may cause severe shifts in zero and calibration, and then cause erroneous readings. 7 The longest duration of IBP arterial catheterization is 7 days. 1 Use only the pressure transducer listed in the IBP Accessories. 2 If measuring intracranial pressure (ICP) on a sitting patient, adjust the transducer on the same level with the top of the patient’s ear. Incorrect leveling may lead incorrect 3 Confirm you set correct alarm limit for labels, the alarm limit you set are stored for its label only. Changing label may change the alarm limit. 4 Don’t perform IBP calibration when a patient is being monitored. 5 When using high frequency ventilation, make sure that the ventilator catheter is not connected to or indirectly connected to the arterial catheter at zero pressure. This can lead to less pressure variations, thus interfere the zeroing process. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.3 Monitoring Procedures Preparatory steps for IBP measurement: 1. Plug the pressure cable into the IBP socket and switch on the monitor. 2. Prepare the flush solution. 3. Flush through the system, exhaust all air from the tube, and ensure that the transducer and stopcocks are free of air bubbles. 4. Connect the patient catheter to the pressure line, making sure that there is no air present in the catheter or pressure line. 5. Position the transducer so that it is at the same level with the patient’s heart, approximately mid-axillary line. 6. For the label name selection, please refer to Selecting a Pressure for Monitoring. 7. To zero the transducer, please refer to Zeroing the Pressure Transducer. If there are air bubbles in the tube system, you should flush the system with the solution again. The bubbles may cause erroneous pressure readings. 15.3.1 Selecting a Pressure for Monitoring Tell the monitor which pressure you want to monitor by selecting its pressure label. The label is a unique identifier for each type of pressure. When you choose a label, the monitor uses that label’s stored settings, for example color, wave scale and alarm settings. The label also determines which algorithm is used to process the pressure signal, so an incorrect label can lead to incorrect pressure values. To select the label, please refer to the following table: Label Description ART Arterial blood pressure PA Pulmonary artery pressure CVP Central venous pressure ICP Intracranial pressure LAP Left atrial pressure RAP Right atrial pressure P1-P2 Alternative non-specific pressure labels The pressure option is only valid when the label is P1/P2 and does not take effect under other labels. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.3.2 Zeroing the Pressure Transducer To avoid inaccurate pressure readings, the monitor requires a valid zero. Zero the transducer in accordance with your hospital policy (at least once per day). You must perform a zero:  When you use a new transducer or tubing;  Every time you reconnect the transducer cable to the monitor;  If you think the monitor’s pressure readings are not correct. When using a pressure module, the zero information is stored in the module. The zeroing procedure is listed as below: 1. Turn off the stopcock to the patient. 2. Vent the transducer to atmospheric pressure, to compensate for the static and atmospheric pressure exerted on the transducer. 3. In the setup menu for the pressure, select Zero Channel: XX or Zero All. (XX stands for the IBP label name). After confirmation, the user can zero the pressure of certain channel or pressure of all channels. After zeroing, the interface displays the result and last calibration time. 4. When you see the message Zero Ok, please close the stopcock to atmospheric pressure, and open the stopcock to the patient. 15.3.3 Troubleshooting the Pressure Zeroing (Taking Art for Example) The status message lists the probable cause of an unsuccessful calibration. Cause Corrective Action Art ZERO FAIL Make sure that the transducer is not attached to the patient. Art SENSOR OFF, FAIL Make sure that transducer is not off, and then proceed zeroing. IN DEMO, FAIL Make sure that the monitor is not in DEMO mode. Contact service technician if necessary. PRESSURE OVER Make sure that the stopcock is vented to atmosphere. If the RANGE, FAIL problem persists, please contact service technician. PULSATILE PRESSURE Make sure that the transducer is vented to air, not connected to a ZERO FAIL patient, and try again. 15.3.4 IBP Calibration IBP is not user-calibrated. Calibration should be performed by a qualified service professional as frequently as dictated by your Hospital Procedures Policy. 15.4 Changing the IBP Waveform Ruler The top, middle and bottom rulers are available for each channel of IBP waveform. Users can PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP adjust the top, middle or bottom rulers manually: 1. Open the menu Wave Setup of IBP by clicking on the IBP waveform area. 2. Select a suitable ruler from the options TopRuler, MidRuler and BotRuler. 15.5 IBP Waveform Overlapping The monitor can display IBP overlapped waveforms. To set IBP waveform overlapping: 1. Select Menu > Maintenance > User Maintain > Other Setups, and set IBP Wave Overlapping to On or Off. 2. Click the IBP waveform area to show the IBP Wave Setup menu. 3. Select Add IBP Waves and then select the IBP waves for overlapping from the pop-up list. A maximum of four overlapping waveforms can be displayed. 4. After exiting the interface, the main screen will display the overlapped IBP waves. The flashing label is the main label of the waveform area. Click the IBP overlapping waveform area on the main screen, and then select Setup Rulers. The user can select a suitable ruler for the overlapped waveforms from the options TopRuler and 15.6 Measuring PAWP PAWP, Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure, used to assess the cardiac function, is obtained by introducing a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery flotation catheter into the pulmonary artery. When the catheter is in one of the smaller pulmonary arteries, the inflated balloon occludes the artery allowing the monitor to record changes in the intrathoracic pressures that occur throughout the respiration cycle. The user can view the PAWP measurement result via connected CMS. 15.6.1 Measurement Procedures Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP) values are affected by fluid status, myocardial contractility, valve and pulmonary circulation integrity. The most accurate PAWP values are obtained at the end of the respiration cycle when the intrathoracic pressure is fairly constant. You can use the respiration waveform as a reference when assessing the PAWP waveform, to ensure constant measurement timing relative to the respiratory cycle. To start the measurement: 1. On the standard screen interface, select the PA parameter window to enter its setup menu. Then, select Setup > PAWP Activate to open the PAWP measurement window. 2. Prepare and check the accessories according to your hospital policy. 3. Wedge the flotation catheter into the pulmonary artery. Then inflate the balloon and pay attention to PA waveform changes on the screen. 4. After obtaining a stable PAWP waveform, press Freeze to freeze the waveform. In freeze status, you can adjust the PAWP scale to an appropriate position by selecting Measure and moving the cursors up and down according to the clinical experience. Select Confirm to PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP store the PAWP, CVP, HR values. To review the frozen waveform, press s Browse and move the cursors up and down as desired. If you need to review the stored PAWP, CVP, HR values, select PAWP Review. 5. Deflate the balloon when the monitor prompts you “Please deflate the balloon!”. 6. If you need to start a new measurement, select Remeasure. 7. Click on Exit or select Setup > PAWP Exit to exit. 1 Prolonged inflation can cause pulmonary hemorrhage, infarction or both. Inflate the balloon for the minimum time necessary to get an accurate measurement. 2 If the PAWP (mean) is greater than the PAP (systolic), deflate the balloon and report the incident in accordance with hospital policy, because the pulmonary artery could be accidently ruptured, and the PAWP value derived will not reflect the patient’s hemodynamic state, but will merely reflect the pressure in the catheter or balloon. 3 The pressure receiver in the catheter records the pressure change that occurs only at the front of the obstruction. 4 Due to the short measurement delay, do not use sidestream CO as a direct reference to determine the end point of the breath in the pressure curve. 5 If the balloon is not inflated but the pulmonary artery floating catheter enters the wedge position, the pulmonary artery pressure waveform becomes wedge-shaped. Follow the standard steps to take appropriate action to correct this situation. 6 PAWP measurement is not applicable to pediatric and neonate patients. 15.7 Calculating CPP CPP is calculated by subtracting MAP and ICP, it means: CPP=MAP-ICP. 15.7.1 Measurement Procedures To start CPP calculation: 1. Click the ICP parameter area to enter into ICP Options interface, select Setup to enter into ICP Setup > CPP Source; CPP source is defaulted as the currently opened artery, it can be selected as Art, P1 or P2. If there is more than one arterial pressure at the same time, the priority level should be: Art > P1 > P2. 2. Take P1 as example: if P1 is selected as CPP Source, when MAP and ICP are both measured, ICP area will display CPP and its value as below picture, unit is same as ICP. Invalid CPP will display “-?-”. CPP will be closed if exit ICP parameter. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring IBP 15.8 Calculating PPV Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) is calculated from the specific arterial pressure values, which reflects the variation between the maximal pulse pressure and the minimum pulse pressure in 30 seconds. Pulse pressure is affected by left ventricular-stroke volume, arterial resistance and arterial compliance. 1 The clinical value of the derived PPV information must be determined by a physician. According to recent scientific literature, the PPV information is restricted to sedated patients who receive controlled mechanical ventilation and without arrhythmia. Whether the calculation results in other situations are clinically significant, applicable and reliable must be determined by a physician. 2 In below situations, the calculated PPV value may be inaccurate: - the respiration rate is lower than 8 rpm - the tidal volume during ventilation is lower than 8 ml/kg - patients have acute right ventricular functional disorder (pulmonary heart disease) 3 PPV measurement has been validated only for adult patients. PPV is calculated according to the following equation: PPV= (PPmax – PPmin)/(PPmax + PPmin)/2) * 100% To select an arterial pressure as PPV source: 1. Click the PPV parameter area to enter PPV Setup menu. 2. Select Art, P1, P2, or AUTO as PPV Source. Only when P1 and P2 are arterial pressure can they be selected as PPV source. When it is set to AUTO and if there is more than one arterial pressure at the same time, the priority level should be: Art > P1 > P2. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring CO Chapter 16 Monitoring CO ",

PM PRO-2 User Manual Basic Operation Chapter 4 Basic Operation This user manual is based on the maximum configuration and therefore your monitor may not have all of the functions and options described in the manual. Also, illustrations in this manual serve as examples only and do not necessarily reflect the setup on your monitor. The content displayed on you monitor depends on the way it has been tailored for your hospital. You may frequently use the following functions:  ECG monitoring (Refer to Chapter Monitoring ECG for details)  SpO monitoring (Refer to Chapter Monitoring SpO for details)  PR monitoring (Refer to Chapter Monitoring PR for details)  TEMP monitoring (Refer to Chapter Monitoring TEMP for details)  NIBP monitoring (Refer to Chapter Monitoring NIBP for details)  Alarm (Refer to Chapter Alarms for details) 4.1 Introducing the Monitor The monitor can be used in two ways:  As an independent monitor.  As a multi-measurement module for PM PRO-1 patient monitor (also called the host monitor in this manual). Combining its two roles, the monitor helps eliminate data gaps, which is particularly suitable for transport environments. When the monitor is disconnected from the original PM PRO-1 patient monitor, it continues to monitor the patient as an independent monitor running on battery power, eliminating the need for a separate transport monitor. When the monitor is connected to a new PM PRO-1 patient monitor, it can share its patient data and acts its role as multi-measurement module, without losing a moment of critical monitoring information. 4.1.1 Serving as an Independent Monitor The monitor can operate as fully independent monitor. As an independent monitor, the monitor can simultaneously monitor, store, review several parameters data. It can transfer patient data to PM PRO-1 patient monitor as transport monitor. As a highly portable monitor, its compact design makes it particularly suited to transport environments. 4.1.2 Serving as a Multi-Measurement Module The monitor can be coupled with PM PRO-1 patient monitor, where it acts as a multi-measurement module, providing the measurements, trends, and patient information for PM PRO-1 patient monitor. You can connect the monitor to PM PRO-1 patient monitor by plugging it into the host monitor directly or via the cable. When connected to a host monitor, the host monitor controls the connected monitor, including all alarm functionality. No alarms are available on the monitor, and the monitor takes power from the host monitor. Different from other multi-measurement modules, the monitor can store its measurement data and settings. Refer to Section Using the Monitor with a Host Monitor for more information.

PM PRO-2 User Manual Basic Operation 4.12 Power on/Power off Behavior The general rules determining the behavior of the monitor when connected to, or disconnected from power are as follows:  When DC mains power is lost, a battery powered monitor continues to run without interruption on battery power.  The monitor switches on automatically when connected to a running host monitor.  When a battery powered monitor is disconnected from a running host monitor, it continues to run without interruption on battery power.  When the host monitor switches on, the monitor on connection switches on simultaneously.  When the running host monitor switches off, the monitor on connection switches off simultaneously.  When the monitor on connection switches off, the running host monitor remains power-on. 4.13 Using the Monitor with a Host Monitor When you connect the monitor to a host monitor, an integrated system is formed for monitoring a single patient. The following general observations apply to such a system:  The host monitor is the “master” of the system, and only via the host monitor you have full control over all the system’s operation.  General settings from the host monitor are applied to the monitor on connection.  No audible alarms are available on the monitor when connected to a host monitor. The only visual alarm indication is provided by the alarm indicators which are controlled by the host monitor. Alarms become active again as soon as the monitor is disconnected from the host  The date and time on the monitor is synchronized with that of the host monitor. Inconsistent time might occur when the monitor is using with the host monitor for a period of time. Typically, there’s a maximum time difference of 10 seconds in three days. 4.13.1 Setting Parameters When you connect the monitor to PM PRO-1 patient monitor, the monitor acts as a multi- measurement module and you may find module conflicts or IBP label conflicts. You can set the parameters on the PM PRO-1 patient monitor as follows. 4.13.1.1 Accessing the Parameter Menu Select on the bottom of the screen to enter the MeasureSet menu as shown below. The display on your host monitor may be configured to look slightly different depending on the modules mounted. PM PRO-2 User Manual Basic Operation The color in which a measurement connector appears matches the status of the measurement parameter. Colored: indicates the module is activated. Grey: indicates the module is deactivated. Colored with a “!” appearing: indicates a module conflict. For IBP connectors, with a circle-slash symbol appearing: indicates an IBP module For IBP connectors in the module: indicates this module is not configured with an IBP 4.13.1.2 Activating / Deactivating a Parameter Measurement For different measurement parameters, approaches to parameter activation / deactivation may vary a little. Take the parameters ECG and NIBP in the module for example:  To activate / deactivate the ECG measurement, select the ECG connector in the module on the MeasureSet menu, and set the ECG measurement to on or off on the pop-up submenu.  To activate / deactivated the NIBP measurement, select the NIBP connector in the module on the MeasureSet menu, and the NIBP measurement will directly be activated / deactivated. 4.13.1.3 Resolving Module Conflicts This host monitor supports a maximum of eight channels of IBP measurement. Both the PM PRO- 2 module and each V-IBP module provide two channels of IBP measurement. A maximum of four V-IBP modules can be used simultaneously if the PM PRO-2 module is not used, while three if the PM PRO-2 module is used. If eight channels of IBP measurement are loaded, another IBP module’s plugging in will trigger an IBP module conflict; the corresponding IBP connector will be changed into on the MeasureSet menu as an indication. To remove the IBP conflict, unplug the PM PRO-2 User Manual Basic Operation conflicting module and re-plug it while less than eight channels of IBP are loaded. For other modules, only one of the same type is available at a time; another one inserted will be in the conflicting status. For example, if a NIBP module (module A) is loaded then another NIBP module (module B) is inserted, a symbol “!” in red will appear on the corresponding connector on the MeasureSet menu to indicate a module conflict. To use module B, directly select the connector of module B on the MeasureSet menu, and module A is consequently switched to be in conflicting 4.13.1.4 Resolving IBP Label Conflicts Each label must be unique and can only be assigned once. The measurement labels are stored in the measurement modules. If you try to use two measurement modules that have identical labels, this causes a label conflict in the host monitor. For example, an IBP module (module A) has already been loaded and the label Art is used for module A. Then another IBP module (module B) is inserted and the label Art is also used for module B. In this case, a label conflict will be triggered. A prompt indicating IBP label conflict will appear on the left of the screen. Additionally, at the corresponding measurements area, two labels flicker to indicate a label conflict. The label inside the brackets is the conflicting one while the label outside the brackets is the default one assigned by the system. Via comparing the labels displayed on the MeasureSet menu with the label outside the brackets, you may identify the model with a label conflict and accordingly decide on the module to work. The IBP module with a label conflict will not provide any measurement data; besides, the functions of setup, zeroing and calibrating are unavailable. To resolve the label conflict, you have to change the conflicting label into a non-conflicting one. Three resolutions are available: Resolution 1: 1 Select the IBP channel with a label conflict on the screen and open the Options menu. 2 Choose another label among the options from the Alias pull-down list to resolve the label Resolution 2: 1 Deactivate the parameter with label A which works properly or unplug the corresponding 2 The conflicting label A will consequently turn to be available. Resolution 3: 1 Choose another label for label A which works properly. 2 The conflicting label A will consequently turn to be available. PM PRO-2 User Manual Alarms Chapter 5 Alarms A potential hazard can exist if different alarm presets are used for the same or similar equipment in any single area, e.g. an intensive care unit or cardiac operating room. 5.1 Alarm Category The monitor provides two types of alarm: physiological alarms and technical alarms. Also, the monitor provides prompts. 5.1.1 Physiological alarms If one or several physiological parameters of the currently monitored patient exceed the predefined alarm limit, the monitor will give an alarm, and this type of alarm is called physiological alarms. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to the Section Physiological Alarm Information. 5.1.2 Technical Alarms If one or several technical status of the device is in abnormal status, the monitor will give an alarm. And this type of alarm is called technical alarms. Technical alarms can’t be disabled. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to Section Technical Alarm Information. 5.1.3 Prompts The monitor can give the character indication of monitoring process or other functions. And this character is called prompts. About the detailed alarm information, please refer to Section Prompts. 5.2 Alarm Levels In terms of severity, the device’s alarm levels can be classified into three categories: high level alarms, medium level alarms and low level alarms. 1. High level alarms A high level alarm intensively warns the operator of a high priority alarm condition which requires immediate operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in death or irreversible injury of the patient. 2. Medium level alarms A medium level alarm warns the operator of a medium priority alarm condition which requires prompt operator response. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in reversible injury of the patient. 3. Low level alarms A low level alarm reminds the operator of a low priority alarm condition which requires response. And the response time for a low priority alarm condition can be greater than that for PM PRO-2 User Manual Alarms a medium priority alarm condition. Failure to respond to the cause of the alarm condition is likely to result in discomfort or reversible minor injury of the patient. Alarm Sound The high/medium/low-level alarms are indicated by the system in following different audio ways: Alarm level Prompt Mode is “DO-DO-DO------DO-DO, DO-DO-DO------DO-DO”, which is triggered once every 10 seconds. The alarm indicator flashes in red, with frequency of 1.4 Hz～2.8 Hz. The alarm message flashes with red background, and the symbol *** is displayed at the alarm area.

Chapter 17 Monitoring C.O.* *not available in U.S.A. 17.1 Overview The cardiac output (C.O.) measurement invasively measures cardiac output and other hemodynamic parameters by using the Thermodilution method. The Thermodilution method is to inject a cold solution into the blood circulation system and measure the temperature changes caused by the cold solution through the thermistor of the pulmonary artery floating catheter, and the C.O. value is calculated by using the temperature dilution curve. As C.O. is a variable value, a series of measurements must be carried out to obtain a reliable and average C.O. value. Always use the average of multiple measurements for therapy decisions. The monitor can save a maximum of 6 measurement results. 17.2 C.O. Safety Information 1 Make sure that appurtenance applied is in conformity with relevant Medical Device Safety Requirements. 2 Appurtenance should be avoided from contact with conductive metal body when being connected or applied. 3 All invasive procedures involve risks to the patient. Use aseptic technique and follow catheter manufacturer's instructions. 4 The C.O. measurement results may be incorrect during electrosurgery. 5 C.O. floating catheter shall be removed or reinserted after 3 days. 1 To replace the catheter thermistor, please enter the catheter computation coefficient into the Constant item according to the instruction. 2 Please set injection switch well. The calculation of the cardiac output is based on the state of the injection switch at the end of the measurement. Therefore, after the selection of the injection switch is completed, don’t change until the measurement is completed. 3 Please start C.O. measurement after blood temperature is stable, otherwise the measurement may fail. 17.3 C.O. Monitoring Preparing Measurement 1. Plug the C.O. cable into the C.O. socket on V-C.O. module and turn on the monitor. PM PRO-2 User Manual Monitoring C.O. 2.
