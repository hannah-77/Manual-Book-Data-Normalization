Structure The full name of this product is Elitech Plasma Air Sterilizer KJF-B100, here after is referred to as the Air Sterilizer. The Air Sterilizer adopts plasma air disinfection technology with the advantages of low power consumption, high efficacy of dissolution and degradation, no pollution and long life span. Plasma technology used in the Sterilizer is with special design to enhance the efficiency and efficacy and in the meantime, avoid drawback of regular plasma technology and ESP de-dusting technology. Most consumables such as UV lamps, HEPA filters are removed from the Sterilizer to cut the running cost down, while the purification and disinfection efficacy are better than traditional UV air purifiers. 1.1 Structure The Sterilizer is composed of filtration system, plasma generator, electrode assembly, circulating fan, screen, controller, covers, etc. See 1-1 9.Field Electric module 1.Fuselage panel 5.Controller 2.Outlet grid 6.Filter 10.First Filter 3.Fuselage shell 7.Spectrum sterilization module 11.Air inlet grid 4.Fan 8.IFD module 12.Moveable brace Manual Book Medical Plasma Air Sterilizer KJF-B100 1.2 Work principle Description Under the effect of low noise circulating fan, dirty indoor air inhaled in the Sterilizer and firstlypasses initial & middle filters, which filtrates large particles such as hairs. Then the filtrated air goes to theplasma sterilization zone and ionized by strong electromagnetic field and transform into plasma. Highenergy electrons and radicals in plasma effectively kill microorganisms, degrade the hazardoussubstances and also absorb small particles in air. Finally activated carbon filter adsorbs and filtrate smell and microorganism residues in the air. After few circulating process, indoor air becomes clean and fresh. 2. Functions & Features 1.Disinfection and features a. Disinfection Efficacy The Sterilizer works continuously at its highest airspeed in an hour in a 100 m3 room can kill ≥90% airborne microorganism. b. Purification Efficacy The Sterilizer works continuously for two hours can help a 100 m3 room of class 1,000,000 room to reach class 100,000, effectively removes particles of ≥0.5μm. c. Remove Smokes And Odors The Sterilizer works continuously for two hours in a room of 100 m3 can remove ≥99% PM2.5, and ≥95% average removing rate of formaldehyde, benzene, TVOC, d. Dynamic Working The Sterilizer can work together with people without any protection measures. It also doesn’t generates hazardous secondary substances to people. e. Three Sterilization Cycles Manual, Timer and Auto. Manual mode, timing mode, users can choose switch according to the actual use. Manual mode: manual start / stop purification through infrared remote control or mobile phone APP. Timing mode: according to the time set to start and stop disinfection, infrared remote controller can set three timing time, APP can set a variety of time and different combinations; f. Easy Operation Far infrared remote control operation and APP (support Android and IOS) operation. Manual Book Medical Plasma Air Sterilizer KJF-B100 Wind speed adjustment: infrared remote control and mobile phone APP settings. Temperature and humidity monitoring: users can check the indoor real-time temperature and humidity by mobile phone APP and panel display. Data check: the remaining time of disinfection and purification shows that the cumulative time query and fault alarm. g. Remote control: Devices support WiFi connections to local area networks; and they support connecting to servers via mobile phones to control devices. Note: i. This function requires a stable LAN; ii. Devices need to be covered by WiFi signals. Connect to the network; (group or public users need to assign specific personnel to operate). h. Environmental monitoring function (Accessory unless specified). PM2.5/TVOC/ temperature / humidity / testing (standard) The indoor PM2.5 concentration was detected dynamically. Users can view the current data of PM2.5 through the panel display screen or mobile APP, and the historical data of PM2.5 through mobile APP.
