In the public health sector, the implementing officers consist of: health supervisor, community health nurse, nurse aide, midwife and public health doctor. In the surgical section, members of his group may consist of a general practitioner, a room nurse, a room chief, a secretary and a receptionist. Routine tasks such as operating the Elitech Sterilisator can be left to others. In view of the above, it is necessary to give the book \"Sterilisator Use Directive\" and if necessary we can provide the book \"Instrument Sterilization Practical Guide with Elitech Sterilisator and Cross-infection Control\". The first time must be understood the meaning and difference of the term decontamination, disinfection and sterilization. The desired degree of decontamination is determined by the risk posed by the instrument. Decontamination: A general term that explains the method of washing, disinfection and sterilization to remove germs attached to medical equipment. Disinfection: A way to kill vegetative, viral and fungal bacteria but not to kill spores. Sterilization: A way to kill or destroy all microorganisms and spores attached to medical equipment. Often there is a misinterpretation of the above terms, such as sterilizing with boiling hot water where it does not kill all spores, viruses and Initial cleaning is an important part of the decontamination process; If the instrument is not cleaned and rinsed first, the blood and other dirt will freeze and stick strongly to the instrument. The attached organism will extend the process of decontamination or sterilization. Elitech Sterilizing Cupboard / sterilisator presents new innovations in the medical world, in the case of Sterilization of medical equipment. With simple technology we make breakthrough in the field of sterilization of medical devices. By applying very high concentrations of ozone gas to sterilization and very high intensity Rays.
