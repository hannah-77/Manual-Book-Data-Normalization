When using it, please straighten the lead wire first. 9.4.3 Electrodes must be stored properly. After prolonged use, the surface of the electrode may be oxidized and discolored due to corrosion and other factors, which may affect signal gain. In this case, the electrode must be 9.5 Silicone rubber roller The silicone rubber roller must be smooth and free from smudges, otherwise it will affect the ECG recording effect. To remove stains on the rollers, use a clean soft cloth dampened with a small amount of alcohol to wipe them along the longitudinal direction, and roll the rollers in the direction of paper delivery while wiping them clean. 9.6 Cleaning the thermal thermal print leads Dirt and dust on the surface of the TPH can affect the clarity of the waveform. To clean the surface of the printhead, open the paper compartment cover after turning off the device, use a clean, soft cloth moistened with alcohol to gently wipe the surface. For residual stains on the print head, moisten it with a small amount of alcohol first, then wipe with a soft cloth. Never use a hard object to scratch the surface, otherwise the printhead will be damaged. Wait for the alcohol to evaporate, then close the paper compartment cover. The printhead should be cleaned at least once a month during normal use. 9.7 Product waste disposal Disposal of packaging materials, used batteries and devices at the end of their life must comply with local laws and regulations, and users should treat used products and materials properly in accordance with laws and regulations, and try to support classification and recycling work.

Electrocardiograph Chapter 8 Troubleshooting 8.1 Auto Power Off  The battery is running low, which causes the overdischarge protection circuit to act.  The AC power supply voltage is too high, which causes the action of the overvoltage protection circuit. 8.2 AC interface  Is the device reliably grounded?  Are the electrodes or lead wires properly connected?  Are the electrodes and skin stained with sufficient conductive  Are metal beds reliably grounded?  Did the patient touch the walls or metal parts of the bed?  Does the patient touch other people?  Are there high-power electrical equipment working nearby? Such as X-ray machine or ultrasonic device, etc. Note: If the interference cannot be eliminated after performing the above actions, use an AC filter. 8.3 EMG interface  Is the room comfortable?  Is the patient nervous?  Is the bedroom cramped? Electrocardiograph  Did the patient speak during recording?  Are the leg electrodes too tight? Note: If the noise cannot be removed after performing the above actions, use an EMG filter. The current recorded ECG waveform will be slightly attenuated 8.4 Basic Shift  Is the electrode installation stable?  Is the lead wire or electrode connection reliable?  Are the electrodes and patient's skin cleaned and smeared with sufficient conductive paste?  Is it caused by the patient's movement or breathing?  Are the electrodes or wires in a bad connection?

When the device is connected to AC power, the battery will be charged automatically. The battery status will be displayed on the right edge of the LCD screen when it is on, as shown in Table 9-1. Once completely discharged, the battery needs 5 hours to charge to 90%, and 5.5 hours to charge to full Table 9-1 Battery status display No. icon Description Status unknown, usually displayed when the instrument is turned on in 1 minute b Using AC power c Using battery, and full power d Using battery, volume: 3/4 e Using battery, volume: 1/2 f Using battery, volume: 1/4 Using battery, but lower power, recommend recharging the battery or using AC AC power supply Note : When charging the battery, the displayed battery level status will switch between f icon to c . icon 9.1.2 The device can print for 3 hours or work more than 10 hours in standby mode when the battery is fully charged. When the device is powered by battery, a battery icon will be displayed on the LCD screen, showing the battery capacity in 5 modes. When the battery capacity is too low for the operation of the device, the device will turn off automatically to avoid permanent damage to the battery. Note: The above data was obtained by Electrocardiograph printing the demo waveform under a test environment of 25°C temperature, 25mm/s speed, and 10mm/mV gain. In actual use, the operating time may be shortened due to the operating conditions and environment 9.1.3 The battery should be recharged timely after it is completely discharged. If it is not used for a long time, the battery must be recharged every 3 months, which can extend the life of the battery. 9.1.4 When the battery is not rechargeable or works no more than 10 minutes after being fully charged, please replace the battery.  Do not attempt to disassemble a sealed battery without permission. Battery replacement must be carried out by professional maintenance personnel authorized by our company, and the same model of rechargeable battery provided by our company must be used.  Do not touch the positive and negative terminals of the battery directly with the wires, otherwise there is a fire hazard.  Do not use the battery near sources of ignition or in an environment where the temperature exceeds 60°C. Do not heat the battery or throw it into fire, water and avoid splashing water.  Do not puncture, hammer or hit the battery or destroy it in any other way, otherwise it will cause the battery to overheat, smoke, deform or a hazard of fire.  Keep it away from the battery when it leaks or emits an unpleasant odor. If battery electrolyte leaks onto skin or clothing, wash it off immediately with water. If electrolytes accidentally get into your eyes, do not rub your eyes, wash them immediately with water and see a  If the battery reaches its useful life, or the battery smells, changes shape, changes color, or is damaged, please stop using the battery and dispose of it in accordance with local regulations. 9.2 Recording Paper To ensure the quality of the ECG waveform, use high-speed thermal recording paper supplied or specified by the company. If you use unspecified recording paper, the recorded ECG waveform may be blurred, faded, and the paper feed may not be smooth. This can even increase device wear and shorten the life of critical parts such as thermal print heads. For information on how to purchase the tape, please contact your dealer or company. Please be careful! 9.2.1 When using recording paper, it is absolutely not allowed to use recording paper with a waxy or grayish/black surface. Otherwise, the wax will Electrocardiograph stick to the printhead heating parts, resulting in abnormal jobs or damage to the printheads. 9.2.2 High temperature, humidity and sunlight can cause the recording paper to change color. Please store the recording paper in a dry and cool place. 9.2.3 Please do not place the recording paper under the fluorescent light for a long time, otherwise it will affect the recording effect. 9.2.4 Please do not mix the recording paper with PVC plastic, otherwise the color of the recording paper will change. 9.2.5 Please use the tape with the specified dimensions. Recording paper that does not meet the requirements may damage the thermal printhead or silicone rubber rollers. 9.3 Care after use 9.3.1 Press the button to turn off the device. 9.3.2 Unplug the power cable and lead cable. Hold the plug head to remove it, and do not pull the cord directly. 9.3.3 Clean the device and accessories, cover them from dust. 9.3.4 Store the device in a cool and dry place, avoid strong vibrations when 9.3.5 When cleaning the device, do not immerse it in the cleaner. The power supply must be disconnected before cleaning. Use neutral detergent for cleaning. Do not use detergents or disinfectants that contain 9.4 Leads and electrodes 9.4.1 The main cable connectivity can be detected by a multimeter. Check that each wire of the main cable is in good contact according to the following table. The resistance of each wire from the electrode plug to the corresponding pin in the main cable plug should be less than 10Ω, the integrity of the lead wire should be checked regularly. Any damage to the lead wire will cause a false waveform of the corresponding wire or all of the wires on the ECG. The lead wires can be cleaned with a neutral solvent. Do not use detergents or disinfectants that contain alcohol (Please do not immerse the lead in liquid for ",
