NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the USG PROMAX is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the USG PROMAX should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the USG PROMAX. b. Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m. Recommended separation distances between portable and mobile RF communications equipment and the USG PROMAX The USG PROMAX is intended for use in an electromagnetic environment in which radiated RF disturbances are controlled. The customer or the user of the USG PROMAX can help prevent electromagnetic interference by maintaining a minimum distance between portable and mobile RF communications equipment (transmitters) and the USG PROMAX as recommended below, according to the maximum output power of the communications equipment. Rated maximum Separation distance according to frequency of transmitter (m) output power of 150 kHz to 80 MHz 80 MHz to 800 MHz 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz transmitter (W) d = 1,2 √𝑃 d = 1,2 √𝑃 d = 2,3 √𝑃 0,01 0,1 2 0,12 0,23 0,1 0,38 0,38 0,73 1 1,2 1,2 2,3 10 3,8 3,8 7,3 100 12 12 23 For transmitters rated at a maximum output power not listed above, the recommended separation distance d in meters (in) can be estimated using the equation applicable to the frequency of the transmitter, where P is the maximum output power rating of the transmitter in watts (W) according to the transmitter manufacturer.

Fig. 4-9 CFM Mode CFM Scanning Hints: PRF: increase/decrease the PRF on the color bar. Imaging of higher velocity flow requires increased velocity scale values to avoid aliasing Wall Filter: affect low flow sensitivity versus motion artifact Color Map: allow you to select a specific color map. It shows the direction of the flow and highlights the higher velocity flows. Color Gain: amplify the overall strength of echoes processed in the CROI Persistence: affect temporal smoothing and color Doppler 'robustness'. Line Density: trade frame rate for sensitivity and spatial resolution. If the frame rate is too slow, decrease the CROI size and the line density. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound 4.3.10 PD (CPA) Mode Power Doppler Imaging (PD) is a color flow mapping technique used to map the strength of the Doppler signal coming from the flow rather than the frequency shift of the signal. Using this technique, the ultrasound system plots color flow based on the number of reflectors that are moving, regardless of their velocity. PD does not map velocity, therefore it is not subject to aliasing. Fig. 4-10 PD Mode Press CPA -key to enter into the CPA mode and then CPA lights is on. Direction PD mode In Power Doppler (CPA) mode, press MENU -knob to pop up the PD Menu. Rotate MENU- knob to select the Pb (CPA) Mode and press MENU-knob to enter into DPD mode. If you need go back to PD mode from DPD mode, you could press CPA key or select the PD mode item in the DPD mode. 4.3.11 Color M Mode (Option) Color M mode is used for fetal cardiac applications. Color flow overlays color on the M-mode image using velocity and variance color maps. The color flow wedge overlays the B-mode image and M-mode timeline. The color flow maps available in M-mode are the same as in CFM mode. Color M-mode is a Doppler mode intended to add color-coded qualitative information concerning the relative velocity and direction of fluid motion within the M-mode image. If the system is in color mode and the probe supports Color M mode (e.g. phased array probe), press M-knob to enter Color M mode. 4.3.12 PW Mode Intended Use: Doppler is intended to provide measurement data concerning the velocity of moving tissues and fluids. PW Doppler lets you examine blood flow data selectively from a small region called the Sample 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound The X axis represents time while the Y axis represents velocity in either a forward or reverse direction. PW Doppler is typically used for displaying the speed, direction, and spectral content of blood flow at selected anatomical sites. PW Doppler can be combined with B-mode for quick selection of the anatomical site for PW Doppler examination. The site where PW Doppler data is derived appears graphically on the B-mode image (Sample Volume Gate). The Sample Volume Gate can be moved anywhere within B-mode image. Fig. 4-11 PW Mode PW mode Exam Procedure:  Get a good B-mode image. Press C-knob to help locate the vessel you wish to examine.  Press PW-knob to display the sample volume cursor and gate.  Position the sample volume cursor by moving the Trackball left and right. Position or re-size the sample volume gate by moving the Trackball up and down, then press Enter-key.  Press UPDATE-key to display PW Doppler spectrum and the system will run in combined B+Doppler mode. The Doppler signal can be heard through the speakers.  Optimize the PW Doppler spectrum, as necessary.  Ensure that the sample line is parallel to the blood flow.  Press FREEZE-key to hold the trace in cine memory and stop imaging.  Perform measurements and calculations, as necessary.  Record results with your recording devices.  Press FREEZE-key to resume imaging.  Repeat the above procedure until all relevant flow sites have been examined.  Replace the probe in its respective holder. When entering Duplex mode for the first time, the Doppler spectrum is not activated. The Doppler Sample Volume appears in the default position, and the B mode image or 2D (either B or Color) mode are active. Moving the Trackball will change the Sample Volume position. Press the Enter-key to toggle the Trackball function between Sample Volume Gate position and size. Press the UPDATE-key after the Sample Volume Gate is defined to activate the Spectral Doppler mode. Press the UPDATE-key for second time to toggle back to 2D (B or Color) update and deactivate the Spectral Doppler. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Doppler mode Scanning Hints: The best Doppler data will be got when the scanning direction is parallel to the direction of the blood flow; when the scanning direction is perpendicular to the anatomic target, you can get the best B mode image, so you should keep the balance as you don't usually get both an ideal B-mode image and ideal Doppler data simultaneously. PRF: adjust the velocity scale to accommodate faster/slower blood flow velocity. Velocity scale determines pulse repetition frequency. Wall Filter: remove the noise caused by vessel or heart wall motion at the expense of low flow sensitivity. Baseline: adjust the baseline to accommodate faster or slower blood flows to eliminate Angle Correct: optimize the accuracy of the flow velocity. It estimates the flow velocity in a direction at an angle to the Doppler vector by computing the angle between the Doppler vector and the flow to be measured. This is special useful in vascular applications where you need to measure velocity. Doppler Gain: allow you to control the background information of spectral. Sweep Speed: control speed of spectral update. Doppler Sample Volume Gate Position and Size (Trackball and SET) Move the sample volume on the B-mode's Doppler cursor. The gate is positioned over a specific position within the vessel.  To move Doppler cursor position, turn the trackball left or right until positioned over the vessel.  To move sample volume gate position, move the trackball up or down until positioned inside the vessel.  To size sample volume gate, press Enter-key to toggle trackball function from sample volume gate positioning to sizing, then move the trackball to change sample volume gate size. Activating Triplex mode  While in B mode, press C-knob and D-knob to access the B+Doppler+Color mode, turn triplex menu on, press the UPDATE-key to enter the Doppler active mode.  While in B mode, press CPA-key and D-knob access the B+Doppler+PD mode, turn triplex menu on, press the UPDATE-key to enter the Doppler active mode. 4.3.13 CW Mode (option) Continuous Wave Doppler allows examination of blood flow data all along the Doppler cursor rather than from any specific depth. Gather samples along the entire Doppler beam for rapid scanning of the heart. Range gated CW allows information to be gathered at higher velocities. It works with a phased array or pediatric probe. If the velocity of the blood flow is even too high for the HPRF mode to detect, you have to try CW mode. Press CW-key to enter CW mode when the probe supports CW mode. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound 4.3.14 HPRF Mode (option) High Pulse Repetition Frequency (HPRF) is a special operating mode of PW Doppler. In HPRF mode, multiple energy pulses are used. This allows higher velocities to be detected without causing aliasing artifacts. HPRF mode is used when detected velocities exceed the processing capabilities of the currently selected PW Doppler scale or when the selected anatomical site is too deep for the selected PW Doppler scale. HPRF is invoked when you are operating in PW Doppler mode and conditions activate HPRF when the velocity scale factor or sample volume gate depth exceeds certain limits. When HPRF is active, multiple sample volume gates appear along the Doppler cursor. Doppler information can be received from any of the multiple sample volume gates. The Doppler signals from all the gates are added together and displayed in one spectrum. It works with a phased array or pediatric probe. 4.3.15 TDI Mode (option) TDI mode is tissue Doppler mode, which is intended to provide information of low-velocity tissue motion, specifically for cardiac movement. Only phased array probe is available for TDI function. 4.3.16 Curved Panoramic Imaging (option) Moving through the probe to get a series of B-mode images, Press Freeze key and turn the menu on, select curved panoramic item, turn it on.

The accuracy of measurements is not only determined by system accuracy, but also by the use of proper medical protocols by the operator. When appropriate, make sure to note any protocol associated with a particular measurement or calculation. CAUTION: Please select the most appropriate ultrasound images, measurement tools and measurement methods for measurements according to your diagnosis needs. The final measurement results must be determined and verified by a physician. Measurement accuracies are affected by many non-technical factors, for example operator's experience, patient's status. Please do not only use the ultrasound measurement results as the sole basis for diagnosis, please always use other clinical information to do integrated diagnostics. This section provides information about taking measurements and describing calculations available in each mode. It includes the following topics:  List of generic measurements  Mode Measurements: Step-by-step instructions for taking specific measurements, organized by  Measurement results display and erasing 5.1 Key for Measurement  Trackball Trackball is used to move the cursor; main functions are as follows: Before starting a measurement, use the trackball to choose the menu options; After starting a measurement, move the trackball to move the cursor, during the measurement, the cursor should not be moved out image area; During the Ellipse method measurement, use trackball to change the length of short axis.

These probes operate by pulsing sound waves into the body and listening to the returning echoes to produce high-resolution brightness mode, and a real time display. 8.2 Care and Maintenance The probes that come with the system are designed to be durable and dependable. These precision instruments should be inspected daily and handled with care. Please observe the following precautions:  Do not drop the transducer on hard surface. This can damage the transducer elements and compromise the electrical safety of the transducer.  Avoid kinking or pinching the transducer cable.  Use only approved ultrasonic coupling gels. 8.2.1 Inspecting Probes Before and after each use, inspect carefully the probe's lens, cable, casing, and connector. Look for any damage that would allow liquid to enter the probe. If any damage is suspected, do not use the probe until it has been inspected and repaired/replaced by a PT SINKO PRIMA ALLOY’s authorized service Keep a log of all probe maintenance, along with a picture of any probe malfunction. The probes are designed to be used only with this ultrasound system. Use of these probes on any other system or a non-qualified probe may cause electric shock or damage on the system/transducer. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound 8.2.2 Cleaning and Disinfecting  Place the probe into the solution of cleaning-disinfectant. Make sure not to immerse the probe into the liquid beyond the immersion level given in the pictures below. Make sure that the probe is covered with the cleaning-disinfectant up to the immersion level during the complete disinfection time.  For the recommended cleaning and disinfection time, please see your Operating Manual.  Scrub the probe as needed using a soft sponge, gauze, or cloth to remove all visible residue from the probe surface.  Rinse the probe with enough clean, potable water to remove all disinfectant residues.  Use a soft cloth to clean the cable and the user section of the probe with the cleaning disinfectant liquid. Make sure that the surface of the probe and cable is wetted thoroughly with the cleaning-disinfectant.  Allow probe to air dry completely.  Reconnect the probe to the ultrasound console and place the probe into it is holder. Probe Immersion Level These transducers are not designed to withstand heat sterilization methods. Exposure to temperatures in excess of 600 C will cause permanent damage. The transducers are not designed to be totally submerged in fluid, as permanent damage will result if the entire transducer is submerged. Probe Safety Handling precautions Ultrasound probes are highly sensitive medical instruments that can easily be damaged by improper handling. Use care when handling and protect from damage when not in use. DO NOT use a damaged 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound or defective probe. Failure to follow these precautions can result in serious injury and equipment Electric shock hazard: The probe is driven with electrical energy that can injure the patient or user if live internal parts are contacted by conductive solution:  DO NOT immerse the probe into any liquid beyond the level indicated by the immersion level diagram. Never immerse the probe connector into any liquid.  Prior to each use, visually inspect the probe lens and case area for cracks, cuts, tears, and other signs of physical damage. DO NOT use a probe that appears to be damaged until you verify functional and safe performance. You need to perform a more thorough inspection, including the cable, strain relief, and connector, each time you clean the probe.  Before inserting the connector into the probe port, inspect the probe connector pins. If a pin is bent, DO NOT use the probe until it has been inspected and repaired/replaced by a PT SINKO PRIMA ALLOY's authorized service engineer.  Electrical leakage checks should be performed on a routine basis by PT SINKO PRIMA ALLOY's authorized service engineer. Mechanical hazard: A defective probe or excess force can cause patient injury or probe damage:  Observe depth markings and do not apply excessive force when inserting or manipulating endocavitary probe.  Inspect probes for sharp edges or rough surfaces that may injure sensitive tissue.  DO NOT apply excessive force to the probe connector when insetting into the probe port. The pin of a probe connector may bend. Special handling instructions Using protective sheaths The use of market cleared probe sheaths is recommended for clinical applications. Reference FDA March 29, 1991 \"Medical Alert on Latex Products\". Protective sheaths may be required to minimize disease transmission. Probe sheaths are available for use with all clinical situations where infection is a concern. Use of legally marketed, sterile probe sheaths is strongly recommended for endo-cavitary procedures. DO NOT use pre-lubricated condoms as a sheath. In some cases, they can damage the probe. Lubricants in these condoms may not be compatible with probe construction. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Devices containing latex may cause severe allergic reaction in latex sensitive individuals. Refer to FDA's March 29, 1991 Medical Alert on latex products. DO NOT use an expired probe sheath. Before using a sheath, verify if it has expired. Endocavitary Probe Handling Precautions If the sterilization solution comes out of the endocavitary probe, please follow the cautions below: Sterilant Exposure to Patient (e.g., Cidex): Contact with a sterilant to the patient's skin for mucous membrane may cause an inflammation. If this happens, refer to instruction manual of the sterilant. Sterilant Exposure from Probe handle to Patient (e.g. Cidex): DO NOT allow the sterilant to contact the patient. Only immerse the probe to its specified level. Ensure that no solution has entered the probe's handle before scanning the patient. If sterilant comes into contact with the patient, refer to the sterilant's instruction manual. Sterilant Exposure from Probe connector to Patient (e.g. Cidex): DO NOT allow the sterilant to contact the patient. Only immerse the probe to its specified level. Ensure that no solution has entered the probe's connector before scanning the patient. If sterilant comes into contact with the patient, refer to the sterilant's instruction manual. Endocavitary Probe Point of Contact: Refer to the sterilant's instruction manual. Probe handling and infection control: This information is intended to increase user awareness of the risks of disease transmission associated with using this equipment and provide guidance in making decisions directly affecting the safety of the patient as well as the equipment user. Diagnostic ultrasound systems utilize ultrasound energy that must be coupled to the patient by direct physical contact. Depending on the type of examination, this contact occurs with a variety of tissues ranging from intact skin in a routine exam to recirculating blood in a surgical procedure. The level of risk of infection varies greatly with the type of contact. One of the most effective ways to prevent transmission between patients is with single use or disposable devices. However, ultrasound transducers are complex and expensive devices that must be reused between patients. It is very important, therefore, to minimize the risk of disease transmission by using barriers and through proper processing between patients. Risk of Infection ALWAYS clean and disinfect the probe between patients to the level appropriate for the type of examination and use FDA-cleared probe sheaths where appropriate. Adequate cleaning and disinfection are necessary to prevent disease transmission. It is the responsibility of the equipment user to verify and maintain the effectiveness of the infection control procedures in use. Always use sterile, legally marketed probe sheaths for intra-cavitary procedures. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Probe Cleaning process: DO disconnect the probe from the system prior to cleaning/disinfecting the probe. Failure to do so could damage the system. Perform Cleaning probe after each use:  Disconnect the probe from the ultrasound console and remove all coupling gel from the probe by wiping with a soft cloth and rinsing with flowing water.  Wash the probe with mild soap in lukewarm water. Scrub the probe as needed using a soft sponge, gauze, or cloth to remove all visible residue from the probe surface. Prolonged soaking or scrubbing with a soft bristle brush (such as a toothbrush) may be necessary if material has dried onto the probe surface. To avoid electric shock, always turn off the system and disconnect the probe before cleaning the Take extra care when handling the lens face of the Ultrasound transducer. The lens face is especially sensitive and can easily be damaged by rough handling. NEVER use excessive force when cleaning the lens face.  Rinse the probe with enough clean potable water to remove all visible soap residue.  Air dry or dry with a soft cloth. To minimize the risk of infection from blood-borne pathogens, you must handle the probe and all disposables that have contacted blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin in accordance with infection control procedures. You must wear protective gloves when handling potentially infectious material. Use a face shield and gown if there is a risk of splashing or splatter. Disinfecting the probes: After each use, please disinfect the probes. Ultrasound probes can be disinfected using liquid chemical germicides. The level of disinfection is directly related to the duration of contact with the germicide. Increased contact time produces a higher level of disinfection. In order for liquid chemical germicides to be effective, all visible residue must be removed during the cleaning process. Thoroughly clean the probe, as described earlier before attempting disinfection. You MUST disconnect the probe from the system prior to cleaning/disinfecting the probe. Failure to do so could damage the system. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound DO NOT soak probes in liquid chemical germicide for longer than is stated by the germicide instructions for use. Extended soaking may cause probe damage and early failure of the enclosure, resulting in possible electric shock hazard.  Prepare the germicide solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. Be sure to follow all precautions for storage, use and disposal. The transducer is not designed to be totally submerged in fluid. Permanent damage will result if the entire transducer is submerged. The immersed part shall not exceed the transducer binding line.  Place the cleaned and dried probe in contact with the germicide for the time specified by the germicide manufacturer. High-level disinfection is recommended for surface probes and is required for endocavitary probes (follow the germicide manufacturer's recommended time).  After removing from the germicide, rinse the probe following the germicide manufacturer's rinsing instructions. Flush all visible germicide residue from the probe and allow to air dry. Ultrasound transducers can easily be damaged by improper handling and by contact with certain chemicals. Failure to follow these precautions can result in serious injury and equipment  Do not immerse the probe into any liquid beyond the level specified for that probe. Never immerse the transducer connector or probe adapters into.any liquid.  Avoid mechanical shock or impact to the transducer and do not apply excessive bending or pulling force to the cable.  Transducer damage can result from contact with inappropriate coupling or cleaning agents:  Do not soak or saturate transducers with solutions containing alcohol, bleach, ammonium chloride compounds or hydrogen peroxide  Avoid contact with solutions or coupling gels containing mineral oil or lanolin  Avoid temperatures above 60°C. Under no circumstances should the transducer be subjected to heat sterilization method. Exposure to temperatures above 60° C will cause permanent damage to the transducer.  Inspect the probe prior to use for damage or degeneration to the housing, strain relief, lens and seal. Do not use a damaged or defective probe. Coupling gels AQUASONIC Gel made by R. P. Kincheloe Company in USA is recommended. In order to assure optimal transmission of energy between the patient and probe, a conductive gel must be applied liberally to the patient where scanning will be performed. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Please do not use any gel or other materials which are not provided by PT SINKO PRIMA ALLOY. Un-authorized gel, lubricants and other materials may corrode probes and other parts of the device, for example the keyboard. This may reduce the safety and effectiveness of the system and probes, and may also reduce the life time of the systems and probes. Damages caused by such reason will not be covered by the warranty. DO NOT apply gel to the eyes. If there is gel contact to the eye, flush eye thoroughly with water. Coupling gels should not contain the following ingredients as they are known to cause probe damage:  Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or any other alcohol-based product.  Mineral oil  Aloe Vera  Olive Oil  Methyl or Ethyl Parabens (pars hydroxybenzoic acid)  Dimethylsilicone Planned maintenance The following maintenance plan is suggested for the system and probes to ensure optimum operation and safety. Daily: inspect the probes After each use: clean the probes disinfect the probes. As necessary: inspect the probes, clean the probes, and disinfect the probes. Returning/Shipping Probes and Repair Parts Transportation dept. and our policy require that equipment returned for service MUST be clean and free of blood and other infectious substances. When you return a probe or part for service, you need to clean and disinfect the probe or part prior to packing and shipping the equipment. Ensure that you follow probe cleaning and disinfection instructions provided in this Manual. This ensures that employees in the transportation industry as well as the people who receive the package are protected from any risk. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound AIUM outlines cleaning the endocavitary transducer: Guidelines for Cleaning and Preparing Endocavitary Ultrasound Transducers Between Patients From,AIUM Approved June 4, 2003 The purpose of this document is to provide guidance regarding the cleaning and disinfection of transvaginal and transrectal ultrasound probes. All sterilization/disinfection represents a statistical reduction in the number of microbes present on a surface. Meticulous cleaning of the instrument is the essential key to an initial reduction of the microbial/organic load by at least 99%. This cleaning is followed by a disinfecting procedure to ensure a high degree of protection from infectious disease transmission, even if a disposable barrier covers the instrument during use. Medical instruments fall into different categories with respect to potential for infection transmission. The most critical level of instruments are those that are intended to penetrate skin or mucous membranes. These require sterilization. Less critical instruments (often called \"semi-critical\" instruments) that simply come into contact with mucous membranes such as fiber optic endoscopes require high-level disinfection rather than sterilization. Although endocavitary ultrasound probes might be considered even less critical instruments because they are routinely protected by single use disposable probe covers, leakage rates of 0.9% - 2% for condoms and 8% - 81% for commercial probe covers have been observed in recent studies. For maximum safety, one should therefore perform high-level disinfection of the probe between each use and use a probe cover or condom as an aid in keeping the probe There are four generally recognized categories of disinfection and sterilization. Sterilization is the complete elimination of all forms or microbial life including spores and viruses. Disinfection, the selective removal of microbial life, is divided into three classes: High-Level Disinfection - Destruction/removal of all microorganisms except bacterial spores. Mid-Level Disinfection - Inactivation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, bacteria, most viruses, fungi, and some bacterial spores. Low-Level Disinfection - Destruction of most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi. Low- level disinfection will not necessarily inactivate Mycobacterium Tuberculosis or bacterial 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound The following specific recommendations are made for the use of Endocavitary ultrasound transducers. Users should also review the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document on sterilization and disinfection of medical devices to be certain that their procedures conform to the CDC principles for disinfection of patient care equipment.

    "4.4 Pembersihan": "1. CLEANING After removal of the probe cover, use running water to remove any residual gel or debris from the probe. Use a damp gauze pad or other soft cloth and a small amount of mild non-abrasive liquid soap (household dishwashing liquid is ideal) to thoroughly cleanse the transducer. Consider the use of a small brush especially for crevices and areas of angulation depending on the design of your particular transducer. Rinse the transducer thoroughly with running water, and then dry the transducer with a soft cloth or paper towel. 2. DISINFECTION Cleaning with a detergent/water solution as described above is important as the first step in proper disinfection since chemical disinfectants act more rapidly on clean surfaces. However, the additional use of a high level liquid disinfectant will ensure further statistical reduction in microbial load. Because of the potential disruption of the barrier sheath, additional high level disinfection with chemical agents is necessary. Examples of such high level disinfectants include but are not limited to:  2-3.2% glutaraldehyde products (a variety of available proprietary products including \"Cidex,\" \"Metricide,\" or \"Procide\").  Non-glutaraldehyde agents including Cidex OPA (o-phthalaldehyde), Cidex PA (hydrogen peroxide & peroxyacetic acid).  7.5% Hydrogen Peroxide solution.  Common household bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) diluted to yield 500 parts per million chlorine (10 cc in one liter of tap water). This agent is effective, but generally not recommended by probe manufacturers because it can damage metal and plastic Other agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds are not considered high level disinfectants and should not be used. Isopropanol is not a high level disinfectant when used as a wipe and probe manufacturers generally do not recommend soaking probes in the liquid. The FDA has published a list of approved sterilants and high level disinfectants for use in _processing reusable medical and dental devices. That list can be consulted to find agents that may be useful for probe disinfection. Practitioners should consult the labels of proprietary products for specific instructions. They should also consult instrument manufacturers regarding compatibility of these agents with probes. Many of the chemical disinfectants are potentially toxic and many require adequate 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound precautions such as proper ventilation, personal protective devices (gloves, face/eye protection, etc.) and thorough rinsing before reuse of the probe. 3. PROBE COVERS The transducer should be covered with a barrier. if the barriers used are condoms, these should be no lubricated and no medicated. Practitioners should be aware that condoms have been shown to be less prone to leakage than commercial probe covers, and have a six-fold enhanced AQL (acceptable quality level) when compared to standard examination gloves. They have an AQL equal to that of surgical gloves. Users should be aware of latex-sensitivity issues and have available no latex-containing barriers. 4. ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE For the protection of the patient and the health care worker, all endocavitary examinations should be performed with the operator properly gloved throughout the procedure. Gloves should be used to remove the condom or other barrier from the transducer and to wash the transducer as outlined above. As the barrier (condom) is removed, care should be taken not to contaminate the probe with secretions from the patient. At the completion of the procedure, hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and Note: Obvious disruption in condom integrity does NOT require modification of this protocol. These guidelines take into account possible probe contamination due to a disruption in the barrier sheath. In summary, routine high-level disinfection of the endocavitary probe between patients, plus the use of a probe cover or condom during each examination is required to properly protect patients from infection during endocavitary examinations. For all chemical disinfectants, precautions must be taken to protect workers and patients from the toxicity of the disinfectant. Amis S, Ruddy M, Kibbler CC, Economides DL, MacLean AB.

After the examination is complete, follow the cleaning and disinfecting, or sterilizing procedures as appropriate. 8.3.2 Operating Transvaginal Probe The transvaginal probe is an endo-cavity probe, for the operation safety, please refer to \"Care and Maintenance\" for cleaning and disinfection. Transvaginal probe should be used with FDA approved condom or probe cover. See the following instructions to put the probe into the condom:  Some patients may be allergic to natural rubber or medical device with rubber contains. FDA suggests that the user to identify these patients and be prepared to treat allergic reactions promptly before scanning.  Only water-solvable solutions or gel can be used Petroleum or mineral oil-based materials may harm the cover.  When the transvaginal probe is activated outside patient's body, its acoustic output level should be decreased to avoid any harmful interference with other equipment. Operation Procedure:  Put on medical sterile glove  Get the condom for the package.  Unfold the condom.  Load some ultrasound gel into condom.  Take the condom with one hand, and put the probe head into the condom.  Fasten the condom on the end of the probe handle.  Confirm the integrity of the condom, and repeat the above steps to the condom if any damage to the condom is found. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound 8.3.3 Cleaning and Disinfecting TV Probe We strongly recommend wearing gloves when cleaning and disinfecting any endocavitary  Every time before and after each exam, please clean the probe handle and disinfect the transvaginal probe using liquid chemical germicides  If the probe is contaminated with body fluids, you should disinfect the probe after cleaning.  Regard any exam waste as potentially infectious and dispose of it accordingly.  Since the probe is not waterproof, you should disconnect it from the system before cleaning or disinfecting. Before and after each exam, please clean the probe handle and disinfect the transvaginal probe using liquid chemical germicides. You can clean the transvaginal probe to remove all coupling gel by wiping with a soft cloth and rinsing with flowing water. Then wash the probe with mild soap in lukewarm water. Scrub the probe as needed and use a soft cloth to remove all visible residues from the transvaginal probe surface. Rinse the probe with enough clean potable water to remove all visible soap residues, and let the probe air dry.  Please remove the cover (if any) before cleaning the probe. (The cover like condom is one time usable).  When cleaning the TV probe, it is important to be sure that all surfaces are thoroughly cleaned. Disinfecting 2% Glutaraldehyde-based solutions have been shown to be very effective for this purpose. Cidex is the only germicide that has been evaluated for compatibility with the material used to construct the probes. To keep the effectiveness of the disinfection solutions, a thoroughly cleaning must be done to the probe before the disinfecting, make sure no residues remain on the probe. Disinfecting Procedure:  Following all precautions for storage, use and disposal, prepare the germicide solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Place the cleaned and dried probe to contact with the germicide, being careful not to let the probe drop to the bottom of the container and thus damage the probe.  After placing/immersing, rotate and shake the probe while it is below the surface of the germicide to eliminate air pockets. Allow the germicide to remain in contact with the fully immersed probe. For high level disinfection, follow the manufacturer's recommended time.  Following all precautions for storage, use and disposal, prepare the germicide solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.  After removing from the germicide, rinse the probe according to the germicide manufacturer's rinsing instructions.  Flush all visible germicide residues from the probe and allow to air dry. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Chapter 9 System Maintenance and Troubleshooting 9.1 Back up information All patient data created is NOT backed-up! It is highly recommended to create a full system backup of patient data regularly and empty the hard disk (HDD), to ensure the hard disk (HDD) has never reached its maximum capacity. To Backup exams to USB DVD/CD+(R)W disk, please confirm that the USB DVD/CD+(R)W storage medium used is clean and not scratched! Do not disconnect an external USB pen drive without stopping it.

Improper use of network connection may cause the virus infections of system and eventually malfunction may occur. 2.5 Biological Safety This product, as with all diagnostic ultrasound equipment, should be used only for valid reasons and should be used both for the shortest period of time and at the lowest power settings necessary (ALARA - As Low As Reasonably Achievable) to produce diagnostically acceptable images. The AIUM offers the following guidelines: Clinical Safety Quoted from AIUM Approved March 26, 1997 Diagnostic ultrasound has been in use since the late 1950s. Given its known benefits and recognized efficacy for medical diagnosis, including use during human pregnancy, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine herein addresses the clinical safety of such There are no confirmed biological effects on patients or instrument operators caused by exposures from present diagnostic ultrasound instruments. Although the possibility exists that such biological effects may be identified in the future, current data indicate that the benefits to patients of the prudent use of diagnostic ultrasound outweigh the risks, if any that may be present. Heating: Elevating tissue temperature during obstetrical examinations creates medical concerns. At the embryo development stage, the rise in temperature and the length of time exposed to heat combine to determine potential detrimental effects. Exercise caution particularly during Doppler/Color exams. The Thermal Index (TI) provides a statistical estimate of the potential temperature elevation (in centigrade) of tissue temperature. Three forms of TI are available: Soft Tissue Thermal Index (TIS), Bone Thermal Index (TIB) and Cranial Bone Thermal Index (TIC). Soft Tissue Thermal Index (TIS). Used when imaging soft tissue only, it provides an estimate of potential temperature increase in soft tissue. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Bone Thermal Index (TIB). Used when bone is near the focus of the image as in the third trimester OB examination, it provides an estimate of potential temperature increase in the bone or adjacent soft tissue. Cranial Bone Thermal Index (TIC). Used when bone is near the skin surface as in transcranial examination it provides an estimate of potential temperature increase in the bone or adjacent soft tissue. Cavitation: Cavitation may occur when sound passes through an area that contains a cavity, such as a gas bubble or air pocket (in the lung or intestine, for example). During the process of cavitation, the sound wave may cause the bubble to contract or resonate. This oscillation may cause the bubbles to explode and damage the tissue. The Mechanical Index (MI) has been created to help users accurately evaluate the likelihood of cavitation and the related adverse effects. MI recognizes the importance of non-thermal processes, cavitation in particular, and the Index is an attempt to indicate the probability that they might occur within the tissue. 2.6 Scanning Patients and Education The Track-3 or IEC60601-2-37 output display standard allows users to share the responsibility for the safe use of this ultrasound system. Follow these usage guidelines for safe operation:  In order to maintain proper cleanliness of the probes, always clean them between patients.  Always use a disinfected sheath on all EV/ER probes during every exam.  Continuously move the probe, rather than staying in a single spot, to avoid elevated temperatures in one part of the patient's body.  Move probe away from the patient when not actively scanning.  Understand the meaning of the TI, TIS, TIB, TIC and MI output display, as well as the relationship between these parameters and the thermal/cavitation bio effect to the tissue.  Expose the patient to only the very lowest practical transmit power levels for the shortest possible time to achieve a satisfactory diagnosis (ALARA - As Low As Reasonably Achievable). 2.6.1 Safe Scanning Guidelines  Ultrasound should only be used for medical diagnosis and only by trained medical personnel.  Diagnostic ultrasound procedures should be done only by personnel fully trained in the use of the equipment, in the interpretation of the results and images, and in the safe use of ultrasound (including education as to potential hazards to the patient and the operator).  Operators should understand the likely influence of the machine controls, the operating mode (e.g. B- mode, color Doppler imaging or spectral Doppler) and probe frequency on thermal and cavitation  Select a low setting for each new patient. Output should only be increased during the examination if penetration is still required to achieve a satisfactory result, and after the Gain control has been adjusted to its maximum value.  Maintain the shortest examination time necessary to produce a useful diagnostic result.  Do not hold the probe in a fixed position for any longer than is necessary. It should be removed from the patient whenever there is no need for real-time imaging or spectral Doppler acquisition. The frozen frame and Cine loop capabilities allow images to be reviewed and discussed without exposing' the patient to continuous scanning. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound  Do not use endo-cavitary probes if there is noticeable self-heating of the probe when operating in the air. Although applicable to any probe, take particular care during trans-vaginal exams during the first eight weeks of gestation.  Take particular care to reduce output and minimize exposure time of an embryo or fetus when the temperature of the mother is already elevated.  Take particular care to reduce the risk of thermal hazard during diagnostic ultrasound when exposing: an embryo less than eight weeks after gestation; or the head, brain or spine of any fetus or  Operators should continually monitor the on-screen thermal index (TI) and mechanical index (MI) values and use control settings that keep these settings as low as possible while still achieving diagnostically useful results. In obstetric examinations, TIS (soft tissue thermal index) should be monitored during scans carried out in the first eight weeks after gestation, and TIB (bone thermal index) thereafter. In applications where the probe is very close to bone (e.g. trans-cranial applications), TIC (cranial bone thermal index) should be monitored. MI> 0.3 There is a possibility of minor damage to neonatal lung or intestine. If such exposure is necessary, reduce the exposure time as much as possible. MI> 0.7 There is a risk of cavitation if an ultrasound contrast agent containing gas microspheres is being used. There is a theoretical risk of cavitation without the presence of ultrasound contrast agents. The risk increases with MI values above this threshold. TI> 0.7 The overall exposure time of an embryo or fetus should be restricted in accordance with Table 2-2 below as a reference: Maximum exposure time Table 2-2 Maximum recommended exposure times for an embryo or fetus  Non-diagnostic use of ultrasound equipment is not generally recommended. Examples of non- diagnostic uses of ultrasound equipment include repeated scans for operator training, equipment demonstration using normal subjects, and the production of souvenir pictures or videos of a fetus. For equipment of which the safety indices are displayed over their full range of values, the TI should always be less than 0.5 and the MI should always be less than 0.3. Avoid frequent repeated exposure of any subject. Scans in the first trimester of pregnancy should not be carried out for the sole purpose of 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound producing souvenir videos or photographs, nor should their production involve increasing the exposure levels or extending the scan times beyond those needed for clinical purposes.  Diagnostic ultrasound has the potential for both false positive and false negative results. Misdiagnosis is far more dangerous than any effect that might result from the ultrasound exposure. Therefore, diagnostic ultrasound system should be performed only by those with sufficient training and education. 2.6.2 Understanding the MI/TI Display Track-3 follows the Output Display Standard for systems that include fetal Doppler applications. The acoustic output will not be evaluated on an application-specific basis, but the global maximum de-rated Ispta must be < 720 mW/cm2 and either the global maximum MI must be < 1.9 or the global maximum de-rated Isppa must be < 190 W/cm2. An exception is for ophthalmic use, in which case the TI = max (TIS_as, TIC) is not to exceed 1.0; Ispta.3 <50mW/cm2, and MI < 0.23. Track-3 gives the user the freedom to increase the output acoustic power for a specific exam, and still limit output acoustic power within the global maximum de-rated Ispta < 720 mW/cm2 under an Output Display Standard. For any diagnostic ultrasonic systems, Track-3 provides an Output Indices Display Standard. The diagnostic ultrasound systems and its operation manual contain the information regarding an ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) education program for the clinical end-user and the acoustic output indices, MI and TI. The MI describes the likelihood of cavitation, and the TI offers the predicted maximum temperature rise in tissue as a result of the diagnostic examination. In general, a temperature increase of 2.5°C must be present consistently at one spot for 2 hours to cause fetal abnormalities. Avoiding a local temperature rise above 1°C should ensure that no thermally induced biologic effect occurs. When referring to the TI for potential thermal effect, a TI equal to 1 does not mean the temperature will rise 1 degree C. It only means an increased potential for thermal effects can be expected as the TI increases. A high index does not mean that bio effects are occurring, but only that the potential exists and there is no consideration in the TI for the scan duration, so minimizing the overall scan time will reduce the potential for effects. These operator control and display features shift the safety responsibility from the manufacturer to the user. So it is very important to have the Ultrasound systems display the acoustic output indices correctly and the education of the user to interpret the value appropriately. RF: (De-rating factor) In Situ intensity and pressure cannot currently be measured. Therefore, the acoustic power measurement is normally done in the water tank, and when soft tissue replaces water along the ultrasound path, a decrease in intensity is expected. The fractional reduction in intensity caused by attenuation is denoted by the de-rating factor (RF), RF = 10(-0.1a f z) Where a is the attenuation coefficient in dB cm-1 MHz-1, f is the transducer center frequency, and z is the distance along the beam axis between the source and the point of interest. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound De-rating factor RF for the various distances-and frequencies with attenuation coefficient 0.3dB cm- 1 MHz-1 in homogeneous soft tissue is listed in the following table. An example is if the user uses 7.5MHz frequency, the power will be attenuated by .0750 at 5cm, or 0.3x7.5x5=-11.25dB. The De-rated Intensity is also referred to as `.3' at the end (e.g. Ispta.3).

Tissue Model: Tissue temperature elevation depends on power, tissue type, beam width, and scanning mode. Six models are developed to mimic possible clinical situations. Thermal Composition Mode Specification Application 1 TIS Soft tissue Unscanned Large aperture (>1cm2) Liver PW 2 TIS Soft tissue Unscanned Small aperture (<1cm2) Pencil Probe 3 TIS Soft tissue Scanned Evaluated at surface Breast color 4 TIB Soft tissue and bone Scanned Soft tissue at surface Muscle color 5 TIB Soft tissue and bone Unscanned Bone at focus Fetus head PW 6 TIC Soft tissue and bone Unscanned/ Bone at surface Transcranial Soft tissue: Describes low fat content tissue that does not contain calcifications or large gas-filled spaces. Scanned: (auto-scan) Refers to the steering of successive burst through the field of view, e.g. B and color mode. Unscanned: Emission of ultrasonic pulses occurs along a single line of sight and is unchanged until the transducer is moved to a new position. For instance, the PW, and M mode. TI is defined as the ratio of the In Situ acoustic power (W.3) to the acoustic power required to raise tissue temperature by 1°C (Wdeg), TI = W.3/Wdeg. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Three TIs corresponding to soft tissue (TIS) for abdominal; bone (TIB) for fetal and neonatal cephalic; and cranial bone (TIC) for pediatric and adult cephalic, have been developed for applications in different An estimate of the acoustic power in milli-watts necessary to produce a 1°C temperature elevation in soft tissue is: Wdeg = 2 I We, for model 1 to 4, where fc is the center frequency in MHz, Wdeg = 40 K D for model 5 and 6, where K (beam shape factor) is 1.0, D is the aperture diameter in cm at the depth of interest. Cavitation is more likely to occur at high pressures and low frequencies in pulse ultrasound wave in the tissue, which contains the bubble or air pocket (for instance, the lung, intestine, or scan with gas contrast agents). The threshold under optimum conditions of pulsed ultrasound is predicted by the ration of the peak pressure to the square root of the frequency. MI = Pr' / sqrt(fc) Pr' is the de-rated (0.3) peak rare-fractional pressure in Mpa at the point where PII is the maximum, and fc is the center frequency in MHz. PII is the Pulse Intensity Integral that the total energy per unit area carried by the wave during the time duration of the pulse. The peak rare- fractional pressure is measured in hydrophone maximum negative voltage normalized by the hydrophone calibration parameter. Display Guideline: For different operation modes, different indices must be displayed. However, only one index needs to be shown at a time. Display is not required if maximum MI is less than 1.0 for any setting of the operating mode, or if maximum TI is less than 1.0 for any setting of the operating mode. For TI, if the TIS and TIB are both greater than 1.0, the scanners need not be capable of displaying both indices simultaneously. If the index falls below 0.4, no display is needed. The display increments are no greater than 0.2 for index value less than one and no greater than 1.0 for index values greater than one (e.g. 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3). Display and Report in Different Mode Located on the upper middle section of the system display monitor, the acoustic output display provides the operator with real-time indication of acoustic levels being generated by the system. For B-Scan Mode Only display and report MI, and start from 0.4 if maximum MI > 1.0, display in increments of 0.2. For Color Mode Only display and report TIS or TIB and start from 0.4 if maximum TI > 1.0, display in increments of 0.2 for values of indices of 2.0 or less, and 0.5 for values of indices greater than 2.0. For Doppler Mode Only display and report TIS or TIB and start from 0.4 if maximum TI > 1 .0, display in increments of 0.2 for values of indices of 2.0 or less, and 0.5 for values of indices greater than 2.0. Below is a simple guideline for the user when TI exceeds one limit exposure time to 4(6-TI) minutes based on the National Council on Radiation Protection. Exposure Criteria for Medical Diagnostic Ultrasound: I. Criteria Based on Thermal Mechanisms. Report No.113 1992'. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Operator Control Features: The user should be aware that certain operator controls may affect the acoustic output. It is recommended to use the default (or lowest) output power setting and compensate using Gain control to acquire an image. Other than the output power setting in the soft-menu, which has the most direct impact on the power; the PRF, image sector size, frame rate, depth, and focal position also slightly affect the output power. The default setting is normally around 70% of the allowable power depending on the exam application mode. Controls Affecting Acoustic Output The potential for producing mechanical bioeffects (MI) or thermal bioeffects (TI) can be influenced by certain controls. Direct: The Acoustic Output control has the most significant effect on Acoustic Output. Indirect: Indirect effects may occur when adjusting controls. Controls that can influence MI and TI are detailed under the bioeffect portion of each control in the Optimizing the Image chapter. Always observe the Acoustic Output display for possible effects. Best practices while scanning HINTS: Raise the Acoustic Output only after attempting image optimization with controls that have no effect on Acoustic Output, such as Gain and TGC. WARNING: Be sure to have read and understood control explanations for each mode used before attempting to adjust the Acoustic Output control or any control that can effect Acoustic Output. Use the minimum necessary acoustic output to get the best diagnostic image or measurement during an examination. Begin the exam with the probe that provides an optimum focal depth and penetration. Acoustic Output Default Levels In order to assure that an exam does not start at a high output level, the system initiates scanning at a reduced default output level. This reduced level is preset programmable and depends upon the exam icon and probe selected. It takes effect when the system is powered on or New Patient is selected. To modify acoustic output, adjust the Power Output level on the Soft Menu. 3D/4D Color Doppler Ultrasound Chapter 3 Preparing the System for Use 3.1 Site Requirements 3.1.1 Operation Environmental Requirements The following environmental conditions are within system tolerances for operation: Temperature : 5° C ~ 35° C Relative Humidity : ≤ 80% Atmosphere Pressure : 700hPa ~ 1060hPa Strong radiation sources or powerful electromagnetic waves (e.g. electro-magnetic waves from radio broadcasting) may result in image ghosting or noise.
