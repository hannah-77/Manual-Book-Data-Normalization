When you need adjustment, you can directly adjust by pressing these 2 buttons, and the number will be flashing and be automatically confirmed within 2  Countdown of the working time. For example, when it shows 05, it would show 04 after working for 1  Either the working time or halt time is set at 00 (Both working time and halt time are set at 00, it would show “P”), the equipment will run output continuously with the cycle operation Examination of the tubing  When the suction is functioning, screw tightly the negative pressure valve in clockwise direction, block off the gas source port with finger or rubber dropper. Or you can also fold and pinch the soft catheter.  The pointer of the vacuum pressure gage will be up to ultimate negative pressure value. Loosen the suction port, the pointer will be down to under 0.02 Mpa. Adjustment of the negative pressure Power it on and it is functioning properly. B lock off the suction port and adjust the negative pressure valve, the pointer on the vacuum gauge should be within 0.02Mpa ~ ultimate negative pressure. Attention the negative pressure goes up when rotating the regulating valve in the clockwise direction. Inspection and examination of the overflow protection device (see  Open the bottle cap, clean the valve subassembly, inspect ball cock device, and the valve disc should be connected properly with the float without fault such as deformation and tear. The float should be moved flexibly without blocking.  Connecting the valve subassembly and put it on the water, making the float exposed to the water surface vertically, and then move down the bottle cap. The float should be floated on the shelf to make the valve plate block off the gas port.  Connecting the liquid bottle properly, connecting the soft tube with the suction inlet and screw the regulating valve, then operate the suction.  Put the soft tube into a scuttlebutt, or simulate the condition under normal use, sucking the liquid into a liquid bottle which is equipped with overflow device. When the level of liquid goes up, the float will rise until the valve port shut down and the suction stop automatically. The ultimate level of the the liquid will change with different methods of  Unscrew the regulating valve and shut down the switch of the equipment.  Open the bottle cap and empty the liquid bottle. When the cap is screwed tightly again, the float should be in the bottom of the float shelf and the valve port should be open. When the situations mentioned above are true, it shows the smooth function of the overflow device.  When the valve of overflow device stop shutting down, there might be two causes if the level of liquid keeps going up: 1. It might be caused by the remained negative pressure 2. The valve port has not be shut down completely. The first situation, when the soft catheter is out of the liquid and then stretch in the liquid again, the liquid level stop going up, The Second situation is that the level of the liquid keeps going up. It requires careful observation. When the liquid is going to spill, the soft catheter should be lifted from the liquid, and shut down the suction apparatus to find out the reason of valve malfunction.  After the float valve shuts down, the suction stops. However, owing to the negative pressure of the tube, the float might still be sucked on the valve port. If this situation occurs, the regulating valve should be loosened or the suction should be stopped. Do not drag the float to avoid the rubber valve being away from the float.  Only after shutting down the apparatus and then discharge the negative pressure can the bottle cork be open.  It is forbidden to use the suction apparatus without overflow device and catheter. Machine halt After installation and debugging, the switch on the suction apparatus should be shut down and then the power plug should be pulled. Operating instruction (Operated by medical professionals)  Before using the apparatus, check the suction apparatus according to the installation and debugging procedure. After making sure the good performance of the apparatus, connecting the disinfectant sucking soft catheter and abdominal cavity pipet. Then the apparatus can be used. Pay attention to the pressure status of pressure gauge and make sure that the pressure can not exceed the approved pressure.  During using, the negative pressure can be adjusted to the required value. Notice the level of the liquid in the bottle. When the liquid level goes up to marker capacity, the operation about sputum suction should be stopped and the bottle should be emptied and cleaned up before reusing it. Otherwise the float will rise until the valve shut down and the suction will be forced to stop. If there active pressure during suction, the operation should be stopped immediately. Attention the use of the suction apparatus should be operated in strict accordance with the program operation under the guidance of the professional medical personnel. Maintenance Replacing the filter If the air filter is full of foam and dust, the color of the filter membrane will changed from light to deep and the suction will be less and even disappear. And in addition the negative pressure value on the vacuum gauge will grow up continuously to over 0.04MPa. If these situations above happen, the filter should be replaced in time.  During using, shutting down of the overflow device and blocking up of the pipe maycause a decrease of suction and rise of negative pressure value. See the trouble elimination and troubleshooting.  The air filter should be changed frequently Replacement of fuse tube The fuse tube was in the case board. When the fuse tube need to be replaced, firstly the power should be off, and then the cover of the fuse tube should be unscrewed. The method and frequency of maintenance  Before stopping the machine, it’s suggested to put some clean water into suction tube in order to clean the pipe walls.  After stopping the machine, users should empty the liquid bottle, clear up the dirt on the bottle and cork with soft brush or rag, and then wash the equipment with clean water, including overflow device and all kinds of tubes. If necessary, unscrew the overflow device and take apart the components and remove the guide tube to thoroughly clean the equipment.  When the equipment is not in use, it should be kept dry and clean. It is suggested to operate the machine every half year.  When the machine runs again, the overflow device, catheter and other tubes must be connected properly according to the tube connection.  The position of the three pins on the guide tube is non- uniform, it should be ensured that the pipe orifice point towards the bottle Taking apart the liquid bottle: 1. unscrew the liquid 2. take off the bottle 3. empty the bottle,and bottle screw the bottle Disinfection method The used sputum suction tube should be cleaned with saline. If the sputum tube is not expedite, it should be replaced. Disposable sputum tube is suggested. The surface of the equipment should be wiped with moist rag after disinfectant soaking. Disposal and abandonment For the disposable suction tube, filter and dressing they should be disposed and abandoned properly as medical waste.
