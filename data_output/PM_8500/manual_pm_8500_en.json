Please refer to instruction of central monitor system for more details. 7.1 Type of Alarm According to the characteristics of alarm, it can be divided into physiological alarm and technical alarm. 1. Physiological Alarm Physiological alarm is often caused by the fact that patient's some physiological parameters are out of the high and low limit of setup alarm, or patient's physiology is abnormal. Physiological alarm messages will be displayed in the physiological alarm area. 2. Technology Alarm Technology alarm is called system error message, it refers to the alarm triggered by the situations that some monitor functions cannot be operated due to incorrect operation or system failure or unreality of monitor result. Technical alarm messages will be displayed in the technical alarm area. In addition to physiological alarm and technical alarm, some messages that relate to system status or patient state will be displayed on the monitor screen. The prompt messages are often displayed. In technological alarm area and prompt message area, the prompt messages that relate to arrhythmia will be displayed in physiological alarm area. Besides, there are some other prompt messages are displayed in the parameter area, for instance: The prompt messages that relate to NIBP will be displayed in NIBP parameter area. 7.2 Alarm Level According to the seriousness of alarm, it can be devided into High Level Alarm, Middle Level Alarm, and Low Level Alarm.

Limbs electrodes should be placed on the soft skin of both hands and feet, and the chest electrode should be placed according to the doctor's needs. As shown below: Patient Monitor PM 8500 ECG Monitoring Installing Electrodes for Surgical Patients The installation of electrodes will depend on the type of surgery that is being performed. For example, with open chest surgery, the chest electrodes may be placed laterally on the chest on the back. In addition, when using ES (Electrosurgery) equipment, in order to reduce the influence of pseudo error on ECG waveform, you can place electrodes on the right and left shoulders, the right and left sides near the stomach, and the chest lead on the left side of mid-chest. Avoid placing the electrodes on the upper arms, otherwise the ECG waveform will be too small.  When using electrosurgery equipment (ESU), ECG electrode should be placed in a position in equal distance from electrotome and the grounding plate to avoid cautery. Electrosurgery equipment wire and ECG cable must not be tangled up.  When using electrosurgery equipment (ESU), never place an electrode near the grounding of the electrosurgery equipment, otherwise there will be a great interference with the ECG signal. 8.3.4 Check Pacing Status Before starting ECG monitoring, it is very important to set the patient's pacing status correctly. When \"PACING\" is \"YES\", the icon is displayed in the ECG waveform area. When the system detects a pacing signal, it marks the symbol \"|\" at the baseline of the ECG waveform, and the color of the symbol is different from that of the waveform. When you set \"PACING\" to \"NO\" or do not set it, the icon is displayed in the ECG waveform area. You can change the pacing status in any of the following ways:  Select the patient information area, or;  Select \"MAIN MENU\"- \"PATIENT MANAGEMENT\"- \"PATIENT INFORMATION\", or;  Select ECG parameter area- \"OTHER SETUP >>\";  Then, set \"PACING\" to \"YES\" in the pop-up menu. If you do not set the pacing status, the monitor will give a prompt tone when the pacing pulse is detected, the pacing icon will flash, and \"Please confirm if the patient has a pacemaker\" will be displayed in the ECG waveform area. At this point, please check and set the pacing status of the  For pacing patients, \"PACING\" must be selected as \"YES\". Otherwise, the pacing pulse will be treated as a regular QRS complex, and when the ECG signal is too weak, system cannot detect and alarm. Do not rely entirely on the alarm information of heart rate calculation, patients with pacemakers should be placed under close monitoring.  For non-pacemaker patients, \"PACING\" should be chosen as \"NO\".  The automatic recognition function of pacemaker is not suitable for children and newborns. 8.4 ECG Display The following figure is an interface of 5-lead monitoring, only for reference, and the figure displayed on your monitor may vary slightly. In addition, when \"PACING\" is set to \"YES\" and the pacing signal is detected, the pacing pulse flag \"|\" is displayed in the ECG waveform. See the description of 12-lead interface in the corresponding chapter. 8.5 Set ECG 8.5.1 Open ECG Menu You can open the ECG menu in the following ways;  Select the ECG parameter area and open the \"ECG SETUP menu.  Select \"MAIN MENU\"- \"MEASUREMENT SETUP\"- \"ECG SETUP\" to open the \"ECG SETUP\" menu. 8.5.2 Set Alarm Source In most cases, the values of heart rate and pulse rate are the same. In order to avoid triggering the heart rate and pulse rate alarm at the same time, the monitor can choose one of them as the alarm source. To change alarm source, first go to the \"ECG SETUP\" or \"SpO SETUP\" menu, select \"ALARM SOURCE\", and then select:  \"ECG\": The monitor uses heart rate as the alarm source of heart rate /  \"SpO \": The monitor uses the pulse rate as the alarm source of heart rate  \"AUTO\": As long as the ECG measurement is turned on, the effective heart rate can be obtained, and the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the data source. If the heart rate is not available, such as when the lead is disconnected, and a pulse source is turned on and available, the monitor automatically takes the pulse rate from the current measurement as the data source and displays it in the ECG parameter display area. After that, if the heart rate can be obtained again, the monitor will automatically restore the heart rate to the data source. If an alarm occurred for the pulse rate or heart rate, both of them will be alarmed. 8.5.3 Select Lead Type In \"OTHER SETUP\" of \"ECG SETUP\", you can set \"LEAD TYPE\". If the system supports automatic lead type recognition, you can set \"LEAD TYPE\" lo \"AUTO\". 8.5.4 Set Monitoring Interface When using 5-lead or 12-lead monitoring, select the \"INTERFACE SELECTION\" hot key, and in the \"INTERFACE SELECTION\" window, you can select the interface type as follows:  \"ROUTINE MONITORING INTERFACE\": Two ECG waveforms are displayed in the waveform area.  \"FULL SCREEN 7-LEAD INTERFACE\": The waveform area displays 7 ECG waveforms, while the waveforms of other parameters are not displayed.  \"HALF SCREEN 7-LEAD INTERFACE\": The upper part of the waveform area displays 7 ECG waveform. When using 12-lead monitoring, you can also select \"FULL SCREEN 12- LEAD INTERFACE\". In the \"ROUTINE MONITORING INTERFACE\", you can also set the \"CASCADE\" in the ECG menu to \"ON\", at this time, the first ECG waveform is displayed by channel-2 waveform location. 8.5.5 Set Filtering Mode The setup of ECG filtering mode determines how to smooth the ECG waveform. In the ECG menu, you can set \"FILTER\" to:  \"MONITORING\": Used under normal measurement.  \"DIAGNOSIS\": Used when diagnostic quality is required. At this point, the unfiltered ECG waveform is displayed, and you can see the changes in the waveform, such as the notch of R wave, the discrete elevation or depression of ST segment, and so on.  \"SURGERY\": Used when the signal is disturbed by high frequency or low frequency. High-frequency interference usually causes high- amplitude spike, causing the ECG signal to look irregular. Low- frequency interference usually leads to baseline drift or thickening. In the operating room, selecting \"OPERATION\" mode can reduce artifacts and interference from electrosurgical equipment. In normal measurement, selecting this method may suppress the QRS complex and interfere with the ECG analysis. • It is recommended that patients should be monitored by \"DIAGNOSIS\" as far as possible when the interference is small. 8.5.6 Set Power Frequency Notch 1. Select ECG parameter area. 2. Select \"OTHER SETUP>>\". 3. Set \"POWER FREQUENCY NOTCH\" to:  \"OFF\": No filtering.  \"ON\": Used when the waveform is jitter. 8.5.7 Set Pace-making Inhibittion Select \"PACE-MAKING INHIBITION\" to \"ON\" or \"OFF\" through \"ECG SETUP\"- \"OTHER SETUP>>\"- \"PACE-MAKING INHIBITION\". When \"PACE-MAKING\" is set to \"YES\":  Turning on \"PACE-MAKING INHIBITION\" will inhibit the display of pace-making signals, but when pace-making signals are detected, the pace-making pulse sign “|” is still displayed above the ECG waveform.  Turning off \"PACE-MAKING INHIBITION\" will not inhibit the display of pace-making pulses. When a pace-making signal is detected, the pace-making pulse sign \"|\" will be displayed above the ECG waveform. When \"PACE-MAKING\" is \"NO\", the setting of \"PACE-MAKING INHIBITION\" does not affect the display of pace-making signal. 8.5.8 Set ECG Waveform Select an ECG parameter area to open the \"ECG SETUP\" menu to set the waveform. Select \"ECG1\" or \"ECG2\" (select different lead types and ECG interfaces, different options will appear in the menu), and then select the appropriate lead. The selected lead waveform should have the following characteristics:  QRS should be completely above or below the baseline and should not be biphasic.  QRS should be high and narrow.  P wave and T wave should be less than 0.2mV.  If the ECG waveform is too small or clipped, you can select \"ECG GAIN\" from the setup menu to change the amplitude of the ECG waveform. Under the \"ROUTINE MONITORING INTERFACE\", \"ECG GAIN\" only changes the amplitude of the selected ECG waveform. In other display interfaces, the amplitudes of all ECG waveforms are changed at the same time.  Select \"WAVEFORM SPEED\": Select appropriate setup in the pop- up list. The higher the value, the faster the scanning speed and the wider the waveform. 8.5.9 Set Smart Lead Off If the \"SMART LEAD OFF\" function has been set to \"ON\", and the lead of the ECG waveform with filtering mode and notch state falls off, if there are other leads available, the system will automatically switch the waveform to the waveform of available leads, and recalculate the heart rate, analyze and detect arrhythmia. When dropped lead is reconnected, the lead will automatically switch back to the original state. Select \"OTHER SETUP >>\" in the \"ECG SETUP\" menu, and set \"SMART LEAD OFF\" to \"ON\" or \"OFF\" respectively in the pop-up menu to turn on or turn off the smart lead off function. 8.5.10 Set Alarm Level Triggered by Lead Off Click \"ALARM SETUP >>\" in the \"USER MAINTENANCE\" menu, and then you can set the \"ECG OFF LEVEL\" in the pop-up menu. 8.5.11 QRS Sound The monitor will emit QRS sound according to the alarm source. You can select \"OTHER SETUP >>\" from the \"ECG SETUP menu, and adjust the \"HEARTBEAT VOLUME\" in the pop-up menu to adjust the QRS 8.6 ST Segment Analysis  ST segment analysis function is not applicable to newborns and is “OFF” by default  ST segment analysis can measure the elevation or depression of the ST segment on the specified lead.  ST segment measurement value is measured in: mV (millivolts) or mm (millimeters). You can select it from the \"UNIT SETUP\" on the \"USER MAINTENANCE\"  The meaning of ST segment measurement value: Positive number indicates elevation, negative number indicates depression. ST segment measurement range: -2,0 ~+2.0 mV  The data accuracy of the classic ST algorithm has been tested, and its clinical signifleance should be determined by doctors. 8.6.1 ST ON/OFF To turn on or turn off the display of the ST parameter area, see the section of setting the parameter display switch. Some clinical situations can make it difficult to obtain reliable ST monitoring, such as:  Low noise leads cannot be obtained;  There are arrhythmias leading to irregular baselines, such as atrial fibrillation/flutter;  The patient is undergoing continuous ventricular pacing;  The patient has left bundle branch block. When these conditions exist, you should consider turning off ST monitoring. 8.6.2 Filter Mode When ST segment analysis is turned on, the filter mode will be automatically converted to “ST”. When ST segment analysis is turned off, the filtering mode automatically returns to the previous manual setup. ST segment analysis function can only be performed when the filter mode is \"DIAGNOSTIC\". When ST segment analysis is turned on, if the filter mode is not \"DIAGNOSTIC\", it will be automatically converted to \"DIAGNOSTIC\" or \"ST\". When ST segment analysis is tured off, the filtering mode automatically returns to the previous manual selup. 8.6.3 ST Display 8.6.3.1 ST Parameter Area The following figure shows the ST display at 5-lead, for reference only, the graphies displayed on your monitor may be slightly different. 8.6.3.2 ST Segment ST segment displays a complete QRS waveform segment of each ST lead. Current segment and current ST value are drawn in the same color as the ECG wave, usually green. Stored refèrence segment and their ST values are drawn in white. The information of ST segment is updated every 10 In routine interface, to display ST clips: 1. Set a non-waveform parameter display area to \"ST\" Select ECG parameter area, and select \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS > >\" to enter the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu. 8.6.4 Save Current ST Segment as Reference Segment Select \"SAVE REFERENCE\" from the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu to save the current set of ST segment as reference segment. You can save up to 20 sets of reference segment. • If 20 sets of reference segments have been saved, the system will automatically delete the first set of ST segment when saving a new set of ST segment. 8.6.5 Change Reference Segment Select and buttons on both sides of \"CHANGE REFERENCE\" in the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu to switch between different groups of ST reference segment. 8.6.5 Delete Reference Segment The currently displayed reference segment can be deleted by selecting \"DELETE REFERENCE\" from the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu and \"OK\" in the pop-up dialog box. 8.6.6 Record ST Segment To record the current ST segment and reference segment, please select \"RECORD\" from the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu. 8.6.7 Set ST Alarm Limit Select \"ST ALARM SETUP >>\" in the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu to set the high limit and low limit of alarm triggered by ST measured value of each lead. 8.6.8 Set ST Alarm Delay Time In the \"OTHER\" window of the \"ALARM SETUP\" menu, you can set ST alarm delay time. 8.6.9 Determine ST Segment Analysis Point As shown in the figure, if the reference point of the ST measurement point is set as the R wave crest point, the ST measurement value of each heartbeat complex is the difference of the vertical distance between the crest point and the two measurement points. ST analysis point When you start monitoring or when the patient's heart rate or ECG waveform changes significantly, you need to adjust the location of the ISO and ST points. The abnormal QRS complex is not considered in the ST segment  Always make sure that the location of the ST measurement point is suitable for the patient being monitored. To adjust ST segment analysis point: 1. Select \"ST POINT SETUP >>\" from the \"ST SEGMENT ANALYSIS\" menu, The three vertical lines in the \"ST POINT SETUP\" window represent the locations of ISO, J, and ST points, respectively. 2. Select and buttons on both sides of \"LEAD BROWSING\", and select an ECG lead with obvious J point and P wave. 3. Select the \"ISO\" and \"J POINT\" options, and then click on the left and right sides of the interface to adjust the position of each point. \"ST POINT\" is set by option.  The ISO point cursor determines the position of the equipotential point relative to the R wave peak. Position the ISO point in the middle of the flattest part of the baseline (between P wave and Q wave or in front of P wave).  The J point cursor determines the position of the J-point relative to the R wave crest. It helps to locate ST points correctly. The J point is located at the end of QRS wave group and at the beginning of ST ST point is located at a fixed distance from the J point ST, J+60/80, J+40, J+60 or J+80. Move J point cursor to position ST point in the middle of ST segment. The system automatically adjusts the location of ST point according to the heart rate of the current patient: When the heart rate of patient is greater than 120, the system will select J+60 to determine the location of ST point; When the patient's heart rate is less than or equal to 120, the system will select J+80 to determine the location of ST point. 8.7 Arrhytmia Analysis Arrhythmia analysis evaluate patient's condition, including heart rate, PVC frequeney, rhythm, and abnormal heartbeat.  The function of arrhythmia is suitable for the detection of ventricular arrhythmias, but not for atrial or supraventricular arrhythmias. Sometimes, it may detect wrong arrhythmia. Therefore, physicians must combine more clinical manifestations to analyze arrhythmia information.  The arrhythmia analysis function is not suitable for newborns. 8.7.1 Arryhtmic Events Arrhytmia Description Classifcation ASYSTOLE No QRS and no ventricular fibrillation or disorder signal within the set asystole threshold.

PAUSE No QRS within set cardiac apnea threshold. Irr. Rhytm Persistent irregular rhythm. Marked Irr. Marked and persistent irregular rhythm. Set arrhythmia alarm Select the ECG parameter area- \"ECG SETUP\"- \"ARRHYTHMIA ANALYSIS > >\", and the alarm for each arrhythmia can be set in the pop-up menu. You can set \"ALARM LEVEL\" to \"HIGH\", \"MEDIUM\", \"LOW\" or \"PROMPT\", or you can set all arrhythmia analysis alarm \"ON\" or \"OFF\". In the \"ALARM SETUP\" menu of \"USER MAINTENANCE\", you can also set whether to turn off the switch of fatal arrhythmia analysis alarm.  If you turn off all arrhythmia analysis alarms, the system cannot give an arrhythmia alarm. Users should pay close attention to the actual clinical condition of patients. 8.7.2 Arryhtmia Threshold Setup Select ECG parameter area or wave area- \"ARRHYTHMIA ANALYSIS >>\"-\"ARRHYTHMIA THRESHOLD\". You can set thresholds for some arthythmias. When the value of an arrhythmia exceeds the threshold, an alarm will be triggered. The setup of asystole time is associated with ECG self-learning. When the HR is less than 30 bpm, it is recommended to set the asystole time to 10 seconds.

Brady  Multif. PVC  PVCs/min High  Irr. Rhythm  Marked Irr. Rhythm You can select \"MAIN MENU\"- \"MAINTENANCE\"- \"USER MAINTENANCE\"- enter user maintenance password- select \"ALARM SETUP >>\", and then set \"EXTENDED ARRHYTHMIA\" to \"ALLOW\" or \"DISABLE\". When \"EXTENDED ARRHYTHMIA\" is set to \"DISABLE\", the system will not analyze and alarm the extended arrhythmia.  When the monitor is connected to the central monitoring system prior to version 3.0.6, please set \"EXTENDED ARRHYTHMIA\" to \"DISABLE\", otherwise, when the extended arrhythmia is present, the central monitoring system may not be able to display these alarms 8.7.4 Review of Arryhtmia See the review chapter. 8.8 ECG Self-Learning 8.8.1 Start ECG Self-Learning Manually During ECG monitoring, when the patient's ECG template changes greatly, you may need to initiate an ECG self-learning. Changes to the ECG template may result in:  False arrhythmia alarm  ST measurement missing  Inaccurate heart rate ECG self-learning enables the monitor to learn new ECG templates to correct arrhythmia alarms and rhythm values, and to restore ST measurements. To start a self-learning manually: Select the \"SELF- LEARNING\" in ECG parameter area.  Please start ECG self-learning manually during the normal rhythm and when the ECG signal is relatively noise-free. Because if ECG self- learning is performed during arrhythmia, it is possible to learn the wrong QRS complex as an ECG template, resulting in missed detection of arrhythmic events. 8.8.2 Automatically Start ECG Self-Learning ECG self-learning starts automatically in the following situations:  Change lead type  Reconnect the lead  Re-receive patient  After completing the calibration, select \"STOP ECG MODULE CALIBRATION\"  During 5/12-Lead monitoring, switching interfece between several options in the interface type.  Change patient pacing setup 8.9 12-Lead Monitoring 8.9.1 Enter 12- Lead Monitoring Interface 1. Select and install 12-lead monitoring electrodes as described above. 2. Set \"LEAD TYPE\" to \"12-LEAD\" and interface type to “FULL SCREEN 12-LEAD INTERFACE”. Under the 12-lead interface, 12 ECG waveforms are displayed in waveform area. Rhythm lead is ECG before entering the interface, which is the first waveform in the upper left position of the 12 channel waveform area. ST values are shown in three columns:  Ant(Anterior): VI, V2, V3, V4  Inf (Inferior) : II, I, aVf,(aVR)  Lat ( Lateral) : I, aVL, VS, V6 Although aVR is displayed in the Inf. column, it is not part of the inferior lead. In addition, 12-guide interface has the following features:  When entering 12-lead interface, the \"FILTER MODE\" is automatically switched to \"DIAGNOSIS\"; when exiting 12-guide interface, the \"FILTER MODE\" is restored to the setup before entering 12-lead interface.  If you are unable to enter 12-lead diagnosis, please check whether all lead wires are connected to the patient and whether the device supports 12-lead working mode. 8.9.2 12- Lead Resting Analysis  12-Lead ECG resting analysis is only applicable to adults. After entering 12-lead monitoring interface, you must wait 11 seconds before the analysis can be carried out, otherwise it will indicate that the data is insufficient and the analysis cannot be carried out. To perform a 12-lend rest analysis, first select the \"CAPTURE\" hot key, after a 10-second countdown, you can select the \"ANALYZE\" hot key, and the system will pop up the menu shown in the following figure. In this menu, you can:  Select \"RECORD RESULT\" to output the results of 12-lead resting analysis through the recorder.  Select \"RECORD WAVEFORM\" to output the results of 12-lead resting analysis and capture 12-lead waveforms through the  Select \"PRINT REPORT to output a 12-lead resting analysis report through the printer. In addition, after selecting the \"CAPTURE\" hot key, you can:  Select the \"BROWSE\" hot key and review the frozen ECG waveform by clicking or swiping the interface.  Select the \"RECORD\" hot key to output captured 12-lead 8.9.3 Review 12- Lead Resting Analysis In the 12-lead interface, select the \"Review\" hot key to review the existing 12-lead resting analysis results. In this window, you can view the waveform by doing the following operations:  Slide the screen left and right to scroll the waveform for viewing;  Slide the screen up and down to switch ECG waveform;  Slide the screen up and down by double fingers to adjust the gain of  Slide the screen left and right by double fingers to adjust the speed of waveform; 8.10 Display area of QT parameters There are four parameters (QT, QT-HR, QTC, ∆QTc) included. Parameter area is shown as below: 8.10.1 Turn on/off QT Before turning on or off the QT parameter area, the QT switch status need to be confirmed in the ECG setup menu, and refer to the chapter on setting the parameter display switch. 8.10.2 QT Setup  Lead-setup of QTc calculation: it can be set to \"Auto\" or corresponding lead  Formula setup of QTc calculation: options include \"Hodges\" \"Bazett\" \"Fridericia\" \"Framingham\" 8.10.3 QT Analysis The baseline waveform is displayed in white in the lower part. The waveform of selected lead is highlighted and displayed in green, and waveforms of other leads are displayed in light green or gray. The starting point of the QRS complex and the ending point of the T- wave are marked with vertical lines. Slide the screen up and down to switch the lead waveform display The reference interface is shown in the figure below: Patient Monitor PM 8500 Resp Chapter 9 Resp 9.1 Introduction Breath was measured by chest impedance method. When the patient breathes, the thoracic activity causes a change in the thoracic impedance between the two ECG electrodes. The monitor produces a respiratory wave on the screen by measuring the impedance change. The monitor calculates the respiration rate (RR) based on the waveform cycle. 9.2 Safety Information  When monitoring the patient's breathing, it is not allowed to use the ECG cable of anti-electric knife type.  If the breath detection level is not set correctly in manual calculation mode, the monitor may not detect the apnea state. If the defection level is set too low, the monitor is more likely to detect cardiac activity and misinterpret cardiac activity as respiratory activity when apnea occurs.  Respiratory measurement does not recognize the reason of suffocation, it will only give alarm if no next respiration is checked within the predetermined time after the last breath, so it can not be used for diagnostic  If operating under conditions complying with EN 60601-1-2 (radiation resistance: 3V/ M), a field intensity greater than 1V/m may result in wrong measurements at all frequeney ranges. Therefore, it is recommended not to use electrical radiation equipment near respiratory detection equipment. 9.3 Resp Display Select the parameter area to open the “Resp Setup” menu.  Respiratory monitoring is not recommended to be used on patients who are very active, as this can cause false alarms. 9.4 Placement for Resp Electrode As the skin is a bad conductor, in order to get a good respiration signal, process the skin where the electrode is placed is necessary. See \"ECG Monitoring\" chapter for skin processing method. Respiration measurement uses standard ECG cable and electrode placement methods. You can use different ECG cables (3-lead, 5-lead, or 12- lead). Respiratory signals are measured between two ECG electrodes. If standard ECG electrode positions are used, these two electrodes are RA (right Patient Monitor PM 8500 Resp arm) and LA (left arm) electrodes in 1 lead, or RA (right arm) and LL. (left leg) electrodes in 11 lead.  In order to obtain the best respiratory wave, RA and LA electrodes should be placed horizontally when I lead is selected to measure respiration; RA and LL electrodes should be placed diagonally when II lead is selected to measure respiration. 9.4.1 Adjust the position of respiratory electrode If you want to measure respiration while measuring ECG, you may need to adjust the positions of the two electrodes that measure respiration. Adjusting the standard position of ECG electrode will lead to changes in ECG waveform and may affect ST and arrhythmia analysis. 9.4.2 Cardiac activity superposition The effect of cardiac activity on respiratory waveform is called cardiac activity superposition. This happens when the respiratory electrode collects impedance changes caused by rhythmic blood flow. Proper placement of respiratory electrodes can reduce this effect. The liver region and ventricle should be avoided from being connected to the respiratory electrode, so as to avoid artifacts generated by the heart or pulsating blood flow, which is especially important for neonates. 9.4.3 Abdominal breathing Some patients have limited chest movement and they breathe mainly through the abdomen. At this time, you may need to place the left leg Patient Monitor PM 8500 Resp electrode at the position where the left abdomen is most expanded to obtain the best respiratory waveform. 9.4.4 Thoracic expansion Some patients (especially neonates), due to their clinical condition, expand their chest laterally, causing a negative intrathoracic pressure. In these cases, it is better to place two RESP electrodes in the right axillary and the left lateral chest areas at the maximum point of breathing movement to optimize the respiratory waveform. 9.5 Select Respiratory Lead In the \"Resp Setup\" menu, you can select \"Resp Lead\" as \"I\" and \"II\". 9.6 Set suffocation delay In the \"Resp Setup\" menu, you can set \"Suffocation Delay\": the time when the patient's suffocation occurs. When the time exceeds the set time, the monitor will trigger an alarm. The \"Suffocation Delay\" settings in Resp and CO modules keep linkage. 9.7 Change calculation mode In the menu of \"Resp Setup\", you can set the \"Calculation Mode\" to \"Auto\" or \"Manual\". The monitor automatically adjusts the detection level according to the waveform height and whether there is cardiac artifact. In this mode, the detecting horizontal dotted line will not be displayed on the respiratory \"Auto\" mode should be selected in the following cases: • The respiratory rate is not close to the heart rate. • Breathing is active with or without continuous positive airway pressure • Patients were mechanically ventilated, except for patients with intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). 2. \"Manual\" In \"Manual\" mode, the respiratory detection level must be set. You can select \"upper dotted line\" and \"lower dotted line\" to manually adjust the position of detecting horizontal dotted line on respiratory waveform. Once set, the detection level will not automatically adapt to different breathing depths. Therefore, if the depth of breathing changes, you may need to change the detection level. \"Manual\" mode should be selected in the following cases: Patient Monitor PM 8500 Resp • The respiratory rate is close to the heart rate. • Patients are given intermittent mandatory ventilation. • Breathing is weak. Try to reset the electrodes to improve the signal In automatic detection mode, if you are monitoring respiration and the ECG is turned off, the monitor cannot compare the ECG with the respiration rate to detect the cardiac activity superposition. At this time, the respiratory detection level is automatically set to high to prevent the superposition of cardiac activity from being detected as respiratory. In manual detection mode, some cardiac activity superposition may trigger the respiration calculator, resulting in incorrect high respiration rate indication or apnea state that cannot be detected. If you suspect that cardiac activity superposition is regarded as respiratory activity, raise the level of respiratory detection to be higher than that of cardiac activity superposition. If the detection level cannot be improved due to the small respiratory waveform, you may need to optimize the electrode position according to the description in the chapter \"Thoracic Expansion\". 9.8 Change waveform  In Manual\" mode, after changing the gain of the respiratory waveform, be sure to check the horizontal dotted line. Open the \"Resp Setup menu. 1. Select \"Gain\": the greater the gain, the higher the waveform amplitude. 2. Select \"Waveform Speed\": Select the appropriate setting in the pop-up list. The larger the value, the faster the scanning speed and the wider the 9.9 Set RR Source To set the RR source; 1. Open the \"Resp Setup\" menu. Select \"RR Source\" and then seleet a source or \"Auto\" in the pop-up The list shows the currently valid RR sources. When you select \"Auto\", the RR source is automatically selected by priority. When there is no valid measurement for the current set RR source, the system will automatically switch \"RR source\" to \"Auto\". Patient Monitor PM 8500 Resp The priority order of RR sources is as follows (from high to low): CO measurement, ECG. The \"RR source\" settings in Resp and CO modules keep linkage. The RR source settings and their descriptions are shown in the table below. Set Item Function Description Automatic Automatically select RR source from high to low according to priority CO From CO measurement ECG From impedance respiratory measurement 9.10 Set alarm properties In the \"Resp Setup\" menu, select \"Alarm Setup > >\". In the pop-up \"Alarm Setup\" menu, you can set the alarm properties of this parameter. Patient Monitor PM 8500 PR Chapter 10 PR 10.1 Introduction The mechanical activity of the heart causes the pulsation of the artery, and the PR (Pulse) value can be obtained by measuring the pulsation. PR values can be obtained by measuring SpO or any kind of arterial pressure (see Chapter \"IBP\"). The color of PR parameter area is consistent with that of SpO parameter or arterial pressure. 10.2 PR Source The currently valid pulse source is displayed in the SpO parameter area. Pulse rate of this pulse source:  It is detected as the pulse of the system and generates an alarm when you select the pulse rate as the alarm source.  It is stored in the monitor's database and can be reviewed in the trend chart/table. In the trend chart, the color of PR curve is consistent with the parameter color of current PR source, and the source of PR in historical data cannot be distinguished.  It is sent to the central monitoring system (if any) through the network. To set PR source: 1. Open the \"SpO Setup\" menu. 2. Select \"PR Source\" and then select a label name or \"Automatic\" in the pop-up list. The list shows currently valid PR sources from top to bottom by priority. When you select \"Automatic\", the system automatically selects the first option in the list as the PR source. When the current PR source does not exist, the system will automatically switch \"PR Source\" to \"Automatic\". 10.3 Set Alarm Source In most cases, the values of heart rate and pulse rate are the same. In order to avoid triggering heart rate and pulse rate alarms at the same time, the monitor can select one as the alarm source. To change the alarm source, first enter the \"ECG Setup\" or \"SpO Setup\" menu, select \"Alarm Source\", and then select:  \"ECG\": The monitor uses heart rate as the alarm source of heart rate/pulse.  \"SpO \": The monitor uses the pulse rate as the alarm source of heart rate/pulse.  \"Auto\": As long as the ECG measurement is turned on and the valid heart rate can be obtained, the monitor will use the heart rate from the ECG measurement as the data source. Patient Monitor PM 8500 PR If the heart rate is not available, such as when the lead is disconnected, and a pulse source is turned on and available, the monitor automatically takes the pulse rate from the current measurement as the data source and displays it in the ECG parameter display area. After that, if the heart rate can be obtained again, the monitor will automatically restore the heart rate to the data source. If an alarm occurred for the pulse rate or heart rate, both of them will be alarmed. 10.4 QRS sound When the alarm source is pulse rate, the monitor will emit QRS sound according to PR source. You can adjust the QRS volume by adjusting the “Pulse Volume” in the “SpO Setup” menu. Patient Monitor PM 8500 SPO Monitoring Chapter 11 SPO Monitoring 11.1 Introduction SpO was measured by a continuous, non-invasive, pulse oximeter method. It measures the luminous flux of light with a specific wavelength mitted from the light source of the sensor, which reaches the photodetector end of the sensor after being absorbed by oxyhemoglobin in the patient's tissue, to obtain blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. This monitor has been calibrated to display functional oxygen saturation. 1. Pleth waveform: The amplitude of Pleth waveform can directly reflect the strength of the patient's pulse signal. The Pleth waveform is not normalized, which is used as the indicator for signal incompleteness. So the accuracy of the measured values may decrease if the waveform does not smooth or stable. When the waveform tends to be smooth and stable, the measured value is the optimal value, and the waveform is the most 2. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO ): The percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in total hemoglobin. 3. Perfusion index (PI): Perfusion index (PI) is the percentage of pulsations and non-pulsations in the blood oxygen signal caused by changes in arterial blood flow. Perfusion index reflects the signal intensity of blood oxygen signal and partly indicates the signal quality. The perfusion index above 1 is the best; 0.3-1 is acceptable; under 0.3 is weak perfusion state, so it is necessary to adjust the probe or select the better perfusion site. During continuous weak perfusion, if possible, verify the saturation status by other methods, 4. Perfusion bar chart: proportional to pulse intensity. 5. Pulse rate (PR): the number of pulses per minute detected (obtained from plethysmographic waveform). 6. The main parameters of the optical sensor are as follows: Red light: The wavelength is approximately 660 mm, and the optical output power is less than 6.65 mW Infrared light: The wavelength is about 905 nm, and the optical output power is less than 6.75 mW 7. Data averaging and signal processing have a delay in the upgrade of SpO2 data values. When the data update period is less than 30 seconds, the time for obtaining dynamic average values will increase, which is arisen from signal degradation, low perfusion or other interference, it depends on the Patient Monitor PM 8500 SPO Monitoring 8. Requirements of the subject: The subject should be 18 to 45 years old, with clean fingers, no nail polish or similar cosmetics on the fingers, and the nails are not too long. During the test, the subject's finger should be fully inserted into the device (as deep as possible). The subject lies flat on a comfortable bed or sits on a bed or chair, in a relaxed state. During the test, the subject's finger should be kept as still as possible (put a flat cushion under the hand could be better).  Excessive ambient light may affect the measured results, such as surgical light (especially xenon light sources), bilirubin lamp, fluorescent lamp, infrared heater and direct sunlight, etc. In order to prevent interference from ambient light, make sure to place the sensor properly and cover the sensor with opaque material.  As to the fingers which are too cold or too thin or whose fingernail is foo long, it may affect the measured results, so please insert the chicker finer such as thumb or middle finger deeply enough Into the probe when measuring.  When inserting the finger, the light emitted from the sensor must be directly irradiated to the side of the fingernail.  During measuring, do not shake the finger and keep quiet, not move.  The pulse oximetry monitor has a specific calibration curve, which is accurate for the combination of the pulse oximetry monitor and the probe, therefore, the functional tester can measure the error part of the monitor that came from the overall error of the monitor/probe system, and this functional tester can also measure the accuracy of the pulse oximetry monitor that replicates this calibration curve.  The claims of SpO2 accuracy shall be supported by clinical study measurements taken over the full range. By artificially inducing to different stable oxygen levels, and collect the SpO2 value in range of 100%~70% at the same time, forming paired data for accuracy analysis.  There are 36 healthy volunteers (male:22, female:14; age: 4-82; skin color: dark black: 2, medium black: 4, light: 25, white: 5) data in the clinical report.  Because pulse oximeter equipment measurements are statistically distributed, only about two-thirds of pulse oximeter equipment measurements can be expected to fall within the accuracy (Arms) of the value measured by a CO-OXIMETER.  Patient simulator has been used to verify the accuracy of PR. Calculating the root mean square of the difference between the pulse rate measurement value and the patient simulator setting value to indicate the PR accuracy. 11.2 Safety Information Patient Monitor PM 8500 SPO Monitoring  The equipped SpO2 probe is only suitable for use with this device. This device can only use the SpO2 probe specifled in this manual. It is the responsibility of the operator to check the compatibility of the device and the SpO2 probe before use. Incompatible accessories may result in device porformance decreasing or cause injury to the patient.  Use only the SpO2 probe specified in this manual, and use it in accordance with the user manual, and observe all warnings and precautions.  When the patient is prone to hypoxia, an oximeter should be used to analyze the blood sample to fully grasp the patient's condition.  Avold using monitors and sensors when using MRI equipment, because the induced current may cause severe burns to the patient.  During continuous long-term monitoring of the patient, the position applied with SpO2 probe should be checked every 2 hours, and appropriate movements should be made when the skin changes or every 4 hours. Some patients may require more frequent examinations, such as newborns, patients with perfusion disorders, or sensitive skin. Because continuous and long-term monitoring may increase unpredictable skin changes, such as allergies, redness, blistering, or pressure necrosis.  For some special patient who need a more careful inspection on the test site, please do not place the device on the edema or tender tissue.  Please do not stare at the red and infrared light emitter (the infrared light is invisible) after turning on the device, including the maintenance staff, as it may be harmful to the eyes.  The person who is allergic to silicone, PVC, TPU, TPE or ABS cannot use this device.  Some models of functional tester or patient simulator can measure the accuracy of the device that reproduces the calibration curve, but it cannot be used to evaluate the accuracy of this device 11.3 Monitoring Steps 1. Select the appropriate pulse oximetry probe according to the module type, patient type and body weight. 2. Clean the measuring parts, such as colored nail polish. 3. Place the probe of pulse oxygen probe on the patient. Patient Monitor PM 8500 SPO Monitoring 4. Select the extension cable and connect according to the SpO interface type of the module. 5. Connect the pulse oximetry probe to the extension cable. 11.4 SpO Setup 11.4.1 Open the SpO Menu You can open the SpO menu in the following ways:  Select the SpO parameter area to open the \"SpO Setup\" menu.  Select \"Main Menu\" - \"Measurement SETUP\" - \"SpO Setup\" to open the \" SpO Setup\" menu. 11.4.2 Set alarm limit Select \"Alarm Settings >>\" in the \"SpO Setup\" menu. In the pop-up menu, you can set the alarm switch, alarm high limit, alarm low limit and recording switch of \"SpO \". When the measured value of SpO is lower than the set alarm low limit or higher than the set alarm high limit, and the alarm is \"On\", medium or high physiological alarm is triggered, prompting \"SpO is too low < alarm low limit\" or \"SpO is too high > alarm low limit\". 11.4.3 Set sensitivity level You can set \"Sensitivity\" to \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\" in the \"SpO Setup\" menu. When the sensitivity is set to \"high\", the monitor is more sensitive to the recognition of tiny signals. When monitoring critically ill patients, the patient’s pulse is very weak, so the sensitivity should be set to \"high\". When monitoring neonates or non-severe patients, if the patient moves noise or invalid small signals may be generated, so the sensitivity should be set to \"medium\" or \"low\" to filter out movement interference and make the measurement more stable. 11.4.4 NIBP same side setup When NIBP and SpO are measured on the same limb of the patient, the \"NIBP same side\" should be set to \"On\" in the \"SpO Setup\" menu to ensure that the physiological alarm state of SpO remains unchanged during NIBP measurement until the NIBP measurement is completed. If it is set to \"off', the weak perfusion caused by NIBP measurement will lead to inaccurate SpO measurement and trigger the physiological alarm of Patient Monitor PM 8500 SPO Monitoring 11.4.5 Set Pleth waveform speed You can set \"Waveform Speed\" in the \" SpO Setup\" menu. The larger the value, the faster the scanning speed and the wider the waveform. 11.4.6 Set SpO probe fall-off alarm level Select \"Alarm Setup >>\" in the \"User Maintenance\" menu, and then set \" SpO fall-off level\" in the pop-up menu. 11.5 Measurement Influencing Factorcs If you doubt the accuracy of the measurement results, please use other methods to check the patient's vital signs first, and then check the monitor and pulse oxygen probe. During the measurement, the following factors may affect the accuracy of the measurement:  External light radiation  Body movement (active or passive movement of the patient)  Diagnostic Test  Weak perfusion  Influence of electromagnetic fields, such as nuclear magnetic resonance equipment  Electrosurgical equipment  Concentration of non-functional hemoglobin, such as carbohemoglobin (COHb) and positive iron hemoglobin (MetHb)  The presence of certain dyes, such as methylene blue and carmine  The pulse oximetry probe is not positioned properly or an incorrect pulse oximetry probe is used.  Shock, anemia, hypothermia or the application of vasoconstrictive drugs cause arterial blood flow to drop to unmeasurable levels. Patient Monitor PM 8500 NIBP Chapter 12 NIBP 12.1 Introduction This monitor uses oscillometry method to measure non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP). It is applicable for adult, pediatric and neonate. In order to know how the oscillometry works, we compare it with auscultatory method.  Auscultatory method: the doctor listens the blood pressure by the stethoscope, to obtain the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure. When the artery pressure curve is normal, the mean pressure can be calculated by the systolic pressure and diastolic pressure  Oscillometry method; the bload pressure cannot he listened by the monitor, it measures the vibration amplitude of cuff pressure. Cuff vibration appears when the blood pressure changes, the cuff pressure corresponding to the maximum amplitude is the mean pressure. The systolic and diastolic pressure can he calculated by the mean pressure. In a word, the auscultatory method measures the systolic and diastolic pressure, then calculates the mean pressure. And the oscillometry measures the mean pressure, then calculates systolic and diastolic pressure. According to IBC 60601-2-30/EN 60601-2-30, NIBP measurement can be performed during electrosurgery and defibrillator discharge. The clinical meaning for NIBP measurement must be determined by the physician. 12.2 Safety Information  Before measuring, make sure the type of your patient. False settings may imperil patient's safety, as higher adult settings are not suitable for pediatric and neonate.  You must not perform NIBP measurement on patients with sickle-cell disease or under any condition which the skin is damaged or expected to be  For the patients with severe clotting mechanism abnormality, please determine whether automatically measure the blood pressure according to the clinical evaluation, as the rub position between the limb and cuff will have the risk of producing hematoma.  Do not apply the cuff to a limb that has an intravenous infusion or catheter. This could cause tissue damage around the catheter when infusion is slowed or blocked during cuff inflation.  If you are in doubt about the accuracy of any reading, check the patient's vital signs by an alternative method before checking the functioning of the  Do not use the cuff on the side of the mastectomy or lymph node dissection. Patient Monitor PM 8500 NIBP  Do not use the cuff on the injured area, otherwise it will care more serious damage to the injured area.  Do not twist or tangle the airway tube, otherwise it will cause continuous pressure in the cuff, then causing blocked blood flow and serious injury to the patient.  Do not use the cuff on the site where intravascular treatment is being performed or with catheter connection, otherwise it may cause temporary blockage of blood flow and then cause injury to the patient.  The pressure by cuff may cause temporary weakness of some funetions of the body, so do not use monitoring medical electrical equipment on the corresponding arm. 12.3 Measurement Limitations NIBP measurement cannot be done on the patients with extreme heart rate (lower than 40 bpm or higher than 240 bpm) or connecting with heart- lung machine. The measurement may be inaccurate or cannot be done in the following conditions:  Difficult to detect regular arterial pressure pulsation  Excessive or continuous patient movement, such as shivering or convulsions  Cardiac arrhythmia  Rapid pressure change  Severe shock or hypothermia decreases the blood flowing to the peripheries.  On edematous limbs 12.4 Measurement Modes There are four measurements methode:  Manual: NIBP measurement is performed manually when necessary.  Automatic: The monitor can automatically and repeatedly measure NIBP according to the set time interval.  Continuous measurement: Continuous measurement is carried out within 5 minutes, and then the monitor returns to the original mode.  Series measurement: during the period set in the series measurement, the measurements are taken according to the duration and measurement interval of each stage, and then the monitor returns to the original mode. 12.5 Measurement Steps 12.5.1 Measurement Preparations 1.

Patient Monitor PM 8500 CO2 Chapter 15 CO2 15.1 Introduction The device adopts infrared absorption technology to measure the CO concentration in the patient's breathing airway. The principle is that the CO molecules can absorb the infrared energy with specific wavelength, and the amount of energy absorbed is directly related to the CO concentration. When the infrared light emitted by the infrared light source penetrates the CO sample, part of the energy will be absorbed by the CO in the gas. On the other side of the infrared light source, use a photodetector to measure the residual infrared light energy which will be converted into the electrical signal. Comparing and adjusting the electrical signal and infrared light energy to accurately reflect the CO concentration in the gas sample. CO measurement methods: 1. Mainstream Install the CO sensor to the airway joint of respiratory system connected to the patient directly. 2. Sidestream The respiratory gas in the patient's respiratory airway was sampled using a constan sampling flow rate and analyzed by a built-in CO  When the temperature of sampling gas is 37°C, room temperature is 23°C, relative humidity is 100%, and the sampling flow rate is 50ml/min, the drying tube reaches to saturation condition after 72 hours. In normal clinical condition, the usable time of drying tube may be longer, but it should be replaced when its color changed. CO measurement can provide: 1. One-channel CO waveform. 2. EtCO2: End Tidal carbon dioxide, CO value measured in the end of respiratory phase 3. InsCO : Inspired Minimum CO 4. AwRR: Air Way Respiratory Rate, respiratory times per minute. 5. Connect for CO transducer 15.2 Preparing to Measure CO2 15.2.1 Sidestream CO2 Module 1. Take \"Lord Rouce\" to connecting for CO2 connector for sampling line in patient monitor . 2.

The message [CO2 Sensor Warmup] is displayed. If you perform CO2 measurements during warm-up, the measurement accuracy may be compromised. 4. After warm-up is finished, you can perform CO2 measurements.  Sidestream connector for sampling line Connection for sidestream and intubated patient 1. For the intubated patient, when using the airway adapter, install the adapter to the near-end of the loop, between the elbow bend and ventilator Y tube, as shown below. integrated airway respiration adapter in the breathing circuit: connect the luer male head on the sampling tube to the concave port of the airway adapter. Patient Monitor PM 8500 CO2  Disconnect the cannula, airway adapter, or sampling tube from the sensor when it is not used.  Before connecting the 3-way stopcock to the breathing circuit, make sure to properly connect the airway adapter and the sensor. Conversely, before removing the sensor, be sure to remove the airway adapter from the brenthing circuit.  Check the airway adapter before using it. If the airway adapter is already damaged or destroyed, do not use it.  Do not use the device in an environment with flammable anesthetic gas.  Only professionals who have received technical training and are familiar with this manual can operate the device.  Accessories should be replaced following good clinical practice or when the monitor prompts a blockage. When the sampling air flow rate is low, the blockage has occurred, and the monitor will send out a prompt message.  When the sampling system of the module is blocked, first check whether the sampling pipes are entangled.  The CO2 module does not require daily calibration. During measuring, if the tube falls off, it is necessary to re-calibrate after connecting well for further measurement. 15.2.2 Measurement setting for mainstream CO2 Module  When using a new airway adapter, it must be zeroed as described in this 1. Connect the sensor to the CO module. 2. The information \"CO SENSOR WARM UP\" will display on the 3. After warm up, connect the sensor to the airway adapter. 4. Refer to relative chapter for zeroing the sensor. 5. After zeroing, connect the gas circuit as the following figure. Patient Monitor PM 8500 CO2  Install the sensor above the adapter to prevent the liquid from gathering on the adapter window.
