Field strengths from fixed RF transmitters, as determined by an electromagnetic site survey, a) should be less than the compliance level in each frequency range. Interference may occur in the vicinity of equipment marked with the following NOTE 1 At 80MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. • Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the ECG Holter System (EHS-12) is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the ECG Holter System (EHS-12) should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the ECG Holter System (EHS-12). • Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m.
