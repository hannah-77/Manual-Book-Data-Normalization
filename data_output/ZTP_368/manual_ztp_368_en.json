ZTP 368 AS STERILISATOR ELECTRIC LINE DIAGRAMS Chapter 12 Care and Maintenance 12.1 The buyer is not permitted to open or unpack the contents in the sterilizer. Any maintenance or renewal must be carried out by a trained and authorized professional person from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. Maintenance must be done with original components from PT. Sinko Prima Alloy. 12.2 Please pull out the power supply steaker when the electric power is about to be turned off. If this sterilizer is not used for a long period of time, please unplug the power supply from the power source, then put this sterilizer in a shady, cool and dry place. 12.3 Sterilizers should be maintained and cleaned regularly. How to clean the Elitech Sterilizer as follows: a.) First of all the power cord must be disconnected from the power source. b.) Prepare a bucket and mix clean water and cleaning agent (liquid soap or neutral detergent) in the right ratio c.) Dip a sponge into the bucket and rub it on the outside and inside of the sterilizer chamber and instrument rack d.) Dip a cloth into a bucket filled with clean water without cleaning agents then rub it evenly throughout the sterilizer to remove foam and soap residue. e.) Use a dry and clean cloth to dry, until the whole Sterilizer is completely dry and clean Additional Chapter In practice, there is no special officer responsible for the decontamination action, all group members play a role in the sterilization and disinfection process. In the public health department, the implementing officers consist of: health supervisors, public health nurses, assistant nurses, midwives and public health doctors. In surgery, group members may consist of general practitioners, room nurses, head of the room, secretaries and receptionists. Routine tasks such as operating the Elitech Sterilizer can be left to someone else. In view of the above, it is necessary to provide the book \"Guidelines for Using Sterilizers\" and if needed we can provide the book \"Practical Instructions for Instrument Sterilization with Elitech Sterilizers and Cross Infection First of all, it must be understood the meaning and difference of the terms decontamination, disinfection and sterilization. The degree of decontamination desired is determined by the risk posed by the instrument. Decontamination: A general term that describes the method of washing, disinfection and sterilization to remove germs attached to medical equipment. Disinfection: A way to kill vegetative bacteria, viruses and fungi but not to kill spores. Sterilization: A way to kill or destroy all microorganisms and spores attached to medical equipment. Often there is a misinterpretation of the term above, such as sterilizing with boiling hot water where this method does not kill all spores, viruses and bacteria. Pre-cleaning is an important part of the decontamination process; If the instrument is not cleaned and rinsed first, blood and other debris will clot and adhere firmly to the instrument. The attached organisms will prolong the decontamination or sterilization process.
