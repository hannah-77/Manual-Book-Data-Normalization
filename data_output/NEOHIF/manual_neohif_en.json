After removing the package of the patient interface, insert the patient interface connector into the heating tube to ensure that the connection ATTENTION：  Please do not change the heating tube and patient interface in any way.  Please use the patient interface provided or specified by our company to avoid burns. 3.5 Oxygent connection NeoHiF: Connect one end of the oxygen connection tube to the oxygen connector of the main unit, and the other end to the oxygen pressure reducer port or the hospital wall oxygen supply port. 3.6 Connecting SpO2 module 3.6.1 Measuring principle The SpO2 module is a non-invasive, continuous medical device for detecting arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The principle is based on the spectral characteristics of hemoglobin and oxyhemo- globin in the red and infrared regions, and the empirical formula of data is established using the \"Lambert Beer\" law. The working prin- ciple of the instrument is to use photoelectric blood oxygen detect- ion technology combined with volumetric pulse tracing technology to illuminate human nails with two different wavelengths of light (660nm red light and 940nm near-infrared light) by absorbing the perspective finger-type sensor. The component acquires the meas- urement signal, and the acquired information is displayed on the display screen through the electronic circuit and the microprocessor for convenient reading. It consists of a two-layer component and a photodetector. Bone, cell tissue, pigmentation, and venous blood vessels all have different absorption constants for light. When arteries pulsate with heart con- traction and relaxation, the amount of light absorbed varies with increasing blood flow. The different absorption rates of light when dilating and contracting the heart are converted to measurements of blood oxygen saturation. This measurement is blood oxygen saturation. module measurement 3.6.2 Connecting Method  Insert the blood oxygen module into the main device USB interface  Insert your finger into the rubber hole (the finger is best extended), with the nail facing up. ATTENTION：  When the oximeter is damaged or the communication fails, the display SpO2 and pulse rate (PR) display the value “--”.  The data update period is 1S.  Before using this product for testing, please wipe the finger grip rubber with medical alcohol. Wipe the tested fingers with medical alcohol before and after use.  Since this module does not have an alarm device, this product is not suitable for continuous monitoring of the patient.  Do not shake your fingers during use. It is best not to be in motion.  Nail must be upward when the fingers are inserted.  Prolonged use of excessive pressure of the blood oxygen sensor rubber hole will cause the finger to be overstressed and damaged. 4.

The customer or the user of the NeoHiF should assure that it is used in such an environment specified by table 1, table 2, table4 and table 9, otherwise, could result in the NeoHiF device improper operation.If you believe your unit is affected by locating it closer to another device, simply separate the devices to remove the condition. NeoHiF has been designed to meet EMC standards throughout its Service Life without additional maintenance. There is always an opportunity to relocate your NeoHiF within an environment that contains other devices with their own unknown EMC behavior.  Use of the NeoHiF adjacent to or stacked with other equipment should be avoided because it could result in improper operation. If such use is necessary, NeoHiF and the other equipment should be observed to verify that they are operating normally.  Use of accessories, transducers and cables other than those specified or provided by the manufacturer could result in increased electromagnetic emissions or decreased electromagnetic immunity of the NeoHiF and result in imp- roper operation.  Portable RF communications equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should be used no closer than 30 cm (12 inches) to any part of the NeoHiF, including cables specified by the manufacturer. Otherwise, deg- radation of the performance of this equipment could result.  If you suspect that the pressure and/or flow rate accuracy is affected by EMC interference remove power and relocate the device to another area. If performance continues to be affected discontinue use and contact your provider.  NeoHiF is designed to capture the SpO2 the accuracy speci- fication described in the sensor manufacturer's instructions for use. If you suspect that your unit is affected by EMC interference remove power and relocate the device to another area. If perfo- rmance continues to be affected discontinue use and contact your provider.

Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and reflection from structures, objects and people. a: Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the device is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the device should be observed to verify normal operation. If abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as re-orienting or relocating the device. b: Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than [V1] V/m.
