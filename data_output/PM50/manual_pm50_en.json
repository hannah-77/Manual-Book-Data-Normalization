Chapter 4 Monitoring SpO2 4.1 What is SpO2 Monitoring The SpO2 Plethymosgram setting is used to determine the oxygen saturation in hemoglobin in arterial blood. If, for example, 97% of the hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells in arterial blood combine with oxygen, then the blood has an oxygen saturation SpO2 of 97%. Numeric SpO2 on the monitor will read 97%. The numerical SpO2 indicates the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that combine oxygen molecules to form oxyhemoglobin. The SpO2/PLETH parameter will provide a pulse signal and a plethymogram waveform. How SpO2/PLETH Parameters Work  Arterial oxygen saturation is measured by a method called a pulse oximeter. Pulse oximeter is a continuous non-invasive method based on different absorption spectra of reduced hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. It measures how much light is sent from a light source on one side of the sensor, then transmitted through the patient's tissue (eg finger or ear), to receive on the other side.  The amount of light transmitted depends on many factors, most of which are constant. However, one of the factors, the absorption of light during pulsation, allows to obtain the oxygen saturation of the arterial blood. Detecting pulsations provides a PLETH waveform and pulse signal.  SpO2 value and PLETH waveform can be displayed on the main display.  Please read the measurement value when the bubbling on the screen is stable. The measurement value is the optimal value. And swell at the moment on a standard. Optical Sensor: Red light (wavelength about 660nm, optical power output less than 6.65mW), infrared light (wavelength about 880nm, optical power output less than 6.75mW). Optical sensors are included in light-emitting components, which will cause interference with other medical equipment with a wide range of wavelengths. This information will be useful for doctors for optical treatment. o Patient Monitor using integrated SpO2 probe (measurement section integrated with o The lifetime of the integrated SpO2 is 3 years. ES (Electrosurgery) cable equipment and SpO2 cables must not be tangled. Do not place the sensor on an extremity with an arterial catheter or venous syringe. Do not take the SpO2 measurement and the NIBP measurement on the same arm at the same time, as blockage of blood flow during the NIBP measurement can affect the SpO2 4.2.1 Warning when Monitoring SpO2/Pulse Rate o Make sure the nails cover the light. The probe cable should be on the back of the hand. Improper installation of the probe or improper contact with the test part will affect the measurement results. o SpO2 values are always displayed in a fixed place. o The testing department must not use external coloring agents (such as nail polish, dyes or colored skin care products, etc.), otherwise it will affect the measurement. o Fingers that are too cold or too small will affect the accuracy of the measurement, please use a thicker finger such as your thumb or middle finger deeper into the probe. o The SpO2 probe is suitable for children and adults (not suitable for infants and newborns). Units are not suitable for all patients. If unable to achieve a stable reading, discontinue use. o Data averaging and signal processing will delay the appearance of data and SpO2 values. The measurement data update time is less than 30 seconds, when the signal attenuation, weak perfusion or other interference appears, it will result in an increase in the dynamic data average time depending on the PR value. o The PLETH waveform is not normalized, which is used as an indicator of signal incompleteness. So, the accuracy of the measured value may decrease when the waveform tends to be not smooth and stable. When the waveform tends to be smooth and stable, the reading is the optimal value, and the current waveform is the most standard. o The temperature for the contact surface of the device with the body is less than 41 °C, and this temperature value is measured by a temperature measuring device. o The device does not provide an alarm function that exceeds the limit, so it cannot be used where the function is required. o The SpO2 probe is calibrated before it leaves the factory. No need to calibrate during maintenance. o The SpO2 probe is calibrated to show functional oxygen saturation. o The SpO2 probe and photoelectric receiving tube should be arranged so that the subject's arterioles are positioned in between. Make sure the optical path is free of optical obstructions such as rubber cloth, to avoid inaccurate measurements. o Since measurements are based on arteriolar pulses, substantial pulsed blood flow from the subject is required. For subjects with a weak pulse due to shock, low ambient/body temperature, heavy bleeding, or use of vascular contracting drugs, the SpO2 (PLETH) waveform will decrease. In this case, the measurement will be more sensitive to interference. o The accuracy of the readings under weak perfusion was verified using signals from the patient simulator. SpO2 and pulse rate values vary within the measurement range due to various weak signal conditions and are compared with the actual SpO2 and pulse rate values of the known input signal. o Claims of SpO2 accuracy must be supported by clinical research measurements spanning the entire spectrum. By artificially inducing different stable oxygen levels, keep them in the 70~100% range. Use secondary standard SpO2 measuring equipment for comparison to collect SpO2 values along with the product being tested, create paired data sets for accuracy o The clinical report recorded data on 12 healthy volunteers, including 6 women and 6 men. The age of the volunteers ranged from 21 to 29 years. Skin color is distributed from dark to light, including 3 dark skin, 2 medium black, 5 light skin, 2 white skin. o When using the device, keep it away from instruments that can generate strong electric or magnetic fields. Using the device in an unsuitable environment may cause interference to nearby radio equipment or affect its operation. o If necessary, please go to our company's official website to download the list of Sp02 probes and extension cables that can be used with this device. o Check if the Sp02 probe cable is in normal condition before measuring. After unplugging the Sp02 probe from the socket, the \"Sp02%\" and \"bmp\" on the screen will disappear. o Do not use the Sp02 probe once the package or probe is found to be damaged. Instead, you must return it to the vendor. o The included Sp02 probe is only suitable for use with this device. This device can only use the Sp02 probe described in this manual. It is the operator's responsibility to check the compatibility of the Sp02 device and probe (and extension cord) prior to use. Incompatible accessories may result in decreased device performance or cause injury to the patient. o Sp02 probe is a medical product that can be used repeatedly. o The measured values may appear normal in the testee who has anemia or hemoglobin dysfunction (such as carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), methaemoglobin (MetHb) and sulfhaemoglobin SuHb)), but the testee may appear hypoxic, it is advisable to carry out further assessment according to the situation and clinical symptoms. o Pulse oxygen has only reference significance for anemia and toxic hypoxia, because some patients with severe anemia still show better pulse oxygen measurements. o Measurement accuracy may be affected by interference with electrosurgery equipment. o Do not attach the Sp02 probe to an extremity with an arterial catheter or receive intravenous injection. o Do not take the Sp02 measurement and the NIBP measurement on the same limb at the same time, because blockage of blood flow during the NIBP measurement can affect the Sp02 value reading. o Excessive movement (active or passive) of the subject or strenuous activity can affect measurement accuracy. o Excessive ambient light can affect the measurement results, such as surgical light (especially xenon light source), bilirubin lamp, fluorescent lamp, infrared heater and direct sunlight, etc. To prevent interference from ambient light, be sure to position the probe properly and cover the probe with an opaque material. o The measured values may not be accurate during defibrillation and for a short time after defibrillation, because the Sp02 probe does not have a defibrillation hold function. with opaque materials. o The measured values may not be accurate during defibrillation and for a short time after defibrillation, because the Sp02 probe does not have a defibrillation hold function. o People who are allergic to silicone, PVC, TPU, TPE or ABS cannot use this device. o For some special patients, the examination should be more careful in the measurement section. The probe cannot be cut in edema and soft tissue. o Do not look directly at the luminescent components when the device is turned on (infrared light is not visible), even for maintenance purposes, or it may be bad for the eyes. o Feelings of discomfort or pain may occur with continuous use of the Sp02 probe, especially for patients with microcirculation barriers. It is recommended that measurements are not taken in the same position for more than 2 hours. Continuous and prolonged measurement can increase the risk of undesirable changes in skin characteristics, such as extreme sensitivity, redness, blistering or pressing necrosis, especially for neonates or patients with impaired perfusion and changes or immature skin shape. Particular attention should be paid to checking the position of the probe placement according to changes in skin quality, correct optical alignment, and method of insertion. Check the attachment position periodically and change it as the leather quality deteriorates. More frequent examinations may be required due to differences in the patient's condition. o Some functional test models or patient simulators can measure the accuracy of devices that reproduce calibration curves, but cannot be used to evaluate the accuracy of these devices. o please refer to the relevant medical literature for detailed clinical limitations and contraindications, o This device is not used for medicinal purposes. o Do not use the SpO2 probe during MRI and CT scans, as the induced current can cause o When the device is ON, if the power is cut off for more than 30 seconds, the SpO2 probe does not require operation after the power is restored, after the device is turned on, make sure the SpO2 probe can be used normally. o The probe can be used before/after exercise, but is not recommended for use during exercise. 5.1 Introduction  The Non-invasive Blood Pressure Module (NIBP) measures blood pressure using the oscillometric method. Namely: using a blade to block arterial blood, checking the oscillometric waveform during degassing to ensure that it is not affected by operator subjective factors or environmental noise interference.  There are two measurement modes available: manual and automatic. Each mode displays diastolic, systolic and MAP blood pressure and pulse.  \"Manual\" mode: Only one measurement is taken at a time.  \"Auto\" mode: Measurement starts automatically the device reaches the automatic measuring point. Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurement in Auto mode can be associated with purport, ischemia, and neuropathy in the cuff-wearing extremity. While monitoring the patient, check the extremities of the extremities frequently for normal color, warmth and sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop measuring blood pressure. You should not take NIBP measurements on patients with sickle cell disease or in any condition whose skin is damaged or expected to be damaged. For thrombasthemic patients, it is important to determine whether blood pressure measurements should be automated. Determination should be based on clinical evaluation. 5.1 Monitoring NIBP  Do not talk or move during measurement.  Do not use a mobile device such as a cell phone near the device when measuring.  The measurement results may differ due to different cuff positions.  Do not touch the device, cuff or extension tube during measurement.  See Safety Precautions for contraindications to NIBP measurements.  Please use the device under proper temperature and humidity (see related chapter), otherwise the measurement result may not be accurate. The minimum value for the patient's physiological signal is the lower limit that the device can measure. Measurement results may not be accurate if the device is running below the minimum amplitude or minimum value of the patient's physiological signal. Prolonged non-invasive blood pressure measurement can be associated with purpura, ischemia, and nerve injury to the cuff-wearing extremity. When monitoring the patient, check the color, warmth and sensitivity of the distal limb as often as possible. If any abnormality is observed, stop measuring immediately or change the location of the cuff. Do not twist or kink the airway tube, otherwise it will cause continuous pressure on the cuff, then cause blockage of blood flow and serious injury to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the injured area, otherwise it will cause more serious damage to the injured area. Do not use the cuff where intravascular treatment is being performed or with a catheter connection, otherwise it may cause a temporary blockage of blood flow and subsequently cause injury to the patient. Do not use the cuff on the mastectomy side; Pressure with the cuff can cause temporary weakness of some body functions. So do not use medical electrical monitoring equipment in the appropriate arm. Do not move during the measurement, as this will affect the patient's blood flow. Do not move during the measurement, as this will affect the patient's blood flow. The device requires a recovery time of 2 hours to reach its intended use performance after being removed from the lowest storage temperature. The device requires a recovery time of 4 hours to reach its intended use performance after being removed from the highest storage temperature. 1. Plug the air hose into the cuff socket on the device, and connect the device to a power source. 2. Place the cuff on the patient's upper arm following the instructions below.  Make sure the cuff is completely deflated.  Place a cuff of the appropriate size on the patient, and ensure that the \"φ\" symbol is above the appropriate artery. Make sure the cuff is not wrapped too tightly around the limb. Cuffs that are too tight can cause discoloration and eventually ischemia of the extremities.  Make sure the edge of the cuff is within the range of the <-> mark. Otherwise, use a larger or smaller cuff that fits better. Figure 5.2 Installation of the cuff 3. Connect the cuff to the air hose. The cuff should be placed at the same level as the patient's heart. If not, modify the measurement results with the following methods:  If the cuff is placed higher than heart level, add 0.75 mm Hg (0.10 kPa) for every inch of difference.  If placed lower than heart level, minus 0.75 mmHg (0.10 kPa) for every inch of difference. 4. Press the NIBP button on the front to start pumping and measuring. Measurement Limit The oscillometric method has some limitations depending on the patient's condition. This measurement is based on a regular pulse wave generated by arterial pressure. In cases where the patient's condition makes such a method of detection difficult, the measured values become unreliable and the measurement time increases. The user should be aware that the following conditions will make the measurement unreliable or the measurement time extended. In this case, the patient's condition will make measurement impossible:  Patient Movement Measurements will be unreliable or unreliable if the patient is moving, shivering or having seizures. This movement can interfere with pulse detection of arterial pressure. In addition, the measurement time will be extended.  Heart arrhythmia Measurements are not reliable and may not be possible if the patient's cardiac arrhythmia has caused an irregular heartbeat. Thus, the measurement time will be extended.  heart-lung machine Measurement will not be possible if the patient is connected to a heart-lung machine.  Pressure Change Measurements will be unreliable and impossible if the patient's blood pressure changes rapidly over a period of time during which the arterial pressure pulse is analyzed to obtain the measurement.  Severe shock If the patient is in severe shock or hypothermia, measurement is not reliable because reduced peripheral blood flow will result in reduced arterial pulse.  Extreme Heartbeat Measurements cannot be taken at heart rates less than 40 bpm and greater than 240 bpm.  Obese patient A thick layer of body fat will reduce measurement accuracy, because fat originating from arterial shock cannot access the cuff due to damping. The following conditions can also cause changes in blood pressure measurement values:  After eating (within 1 hour), or drinking alcohol or caffeine, or after smoking, exercising or  Using wrong postures such as standing or lying down, etc.;  The patient speaks or moves his body during the measurement;  When measuring, the patient is nervous, excited, or emotionally unstable;  The room temperature rises or falls drastically, or the measurement environment changes frequently;  Measuring in a moving vehicle;  Position of cuff attached (higher or lower than heart level); 5.3 NIBP Error Messages and Solutions Error Message Meaning Because 00 No error 02 Self test failure Possible sensor error or A/D 03 No error 04 Low battery Battery voltage is low 05 Cancel measurement Measurement cancelled 06 Remove Cuff Cuff not connected, or too 07 Air leak Air leaks in valves or air 08 Atmospheric pressure error The valve cannot be opened. 09 Weak signal The pulse of the measured subject is too weak or the cuff is loose. 10 Out of range The measured subject's NIBP value exceeds the measurement range. 11 Excessive movement Movement may cause too much interference to the signal during the measurement process. 12 Excessive pressure If the cuff pressure is out of range, the cuff may be blocked or extruded. 13 Saturated signal Movement or other factors can cause the signal amplitude to be too large. 14 Air leak System air duct leak found in leak detection. 15 System failure Possible failure caused by pump, A/D sampling, pressure sensor error, or software operating error. 19 Time has run out Measurement time longer than specified, adults and children: 150 seconds, neonates: 90 seconds -- Error display Check if the battery is installed properly.
