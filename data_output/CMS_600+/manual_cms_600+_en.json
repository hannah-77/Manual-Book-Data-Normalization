A pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) scan produces a series of pulses used to study the motion of blood flow in a small region along a desired scan line, called the sample volume. The X-axis of the graph represents time, and the Y-axis represents Doppler frequency shift. The shift in frequency between successive ultrasound pulses, caused mainly by moving red blood cells, can be converted into velocity and flow if an appropriate angle between the insonating beam and blood flow is known. Shades of gray in the spectral display represent the strength of the signal. The thickness of the spectral signal is indicative of laminar or turbulent flow (laminar flow typically shows a narrow band of blood flow information). Pulsed-Wave Doppler mode and B mode are shown together in a mixed mode display. This combination lets you monitor the exact location of the sample volume on the B image in the B Image Display window, while acquiring Pulsed-Wave Doppler data in the Time Series window. Operation: In the B scan, the long line lets you adjust the sample line position, the two parallel lines (that look like =) let you adjust the sample volume (SV) size and depth, and the line that crosses them lets you adjust the correction angle (PW angle).

Given its known benefits for non-invasive investigations and medical diagnosis, including investigation of the human fetus, the question of clinical safety with regards to ultrasound intensity arises. There is no easy answer to the question of safety surrounding the use of diagnostic ultrasound equipment. Application of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle serves as a rule-of-thumb that will help you to get reasonable results with the lowest possible ultrasonic output. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) states that given its track record of over 25 years of use and no confirmed biological effects on patients or instrument operators, the benefits of the prudent use of diagnostic ultrasound clearly outweigh any risks. A2.2: Ultrasound Safety and the ALARA Principle Ultrasound waves dissipate energy in the form of heat and can therefore cause tissue warming. Although this effect is extremely low with Transcranial Doppler, it is important to know how to control and limit patient exposure. Major governing bodies in ultrasound have issued statements to the effect that there are no known adverse effects from the use of diagnostic ultrasound, however, exposure levels should always be limited to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (the ALARA principle). Imaging Functions Affecting Acoustic Output In addition to the level of voltage transmitted, adjustment of the following imaging functions and /or controls may affect the acoustic output. Item Affection Probe Acoustic output will be changed with the change of probe. There are different parameters applied in B mode, M mode, and PW Imaging mode mode, so acoustic output will be changed with the change of among B mode, M mode, and PW mode. Field of view (scan angle or Frame rate may be changed with the change of the scan angle of the scan width) scan width, and the acoustic output will also be changed. Pulse repeated frequency will be changed with the change of the image Image depth depth, and the acoustic output will be changed. Frame rate and focus position will be changed with the change of the Focus number focus number, and acoustic output will also be changed. Acoustic output will be changed with the change of the focus position Focus position even the beam power level and the beam aperture have not been CMS 600 plus Digital Ultrasonic Diagnostic Imaging System User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety changed. Generally, the acoustic output will be higher with it gets nearer to the probe. Freeze When freezing the system, it will stop transmitting ultrasonic wave. The output of probe will be changed with the change of the transmission Transmission power power, and acoustic output will be changed. The character of the wave focus will be changed with the change of the Multi-frequency frequency, and acoustic output will be changed. The acoustic output will be changed with the change of the number of Line density the scanning line (line density). PRF The acoustic power will be changed with the change of PRF. The pulsed wave and the power will be changed with the change of the Sample volume sample volume, and acoustic output will be changed. Presets contain all the parameters above, so any change of the presetting will change acoustic output. System will return to the default setting when restarting, or powering Restart, or power on/off on/off the system, and acoustic output will be changed. A2.3: Explanation of MI/TI A2.3.1. MI (Mechanical Index) Cavitations will be generated when ultrasound wave passes through and contacts tissues, resulting in instantaneous local overheating. This phenomenon is determined by acoustic pressure, spectrum, focus, transmission mode, and factors such as states and properties of the tissue and boundary. This mechanical bioeffect is a threshold phenomenon that occurs when a certain level of ultrasound output is exceeded. The threshold is related to the type of tissue. Although no confirmed adverse mechanical effects on patients or mammals caused by exposure at intensities typical of present diagnostic ultrasound instruments have ever been reported, the threshold for cavitation is still undetermined. Generally speaking, the higher the acoustic pressure, the greater the potential for mechanical bioeffects; the lower the acoustic frequency, the greater the potential for mechanical bioeffects. The AIUM and NEMA formulate mechanical index (MI) in order to indicate the potential for mechanical effects. The MI is defined as the ratio of the peak-rarefactional acoustic pressure (should be calculated by tissue acoustic attenuation coefficient 0.3dB/cm/MHz) to the square root of acoustic frequency. C MI = 1 (MPa / MHz) CMS 600 plus Digital Ultrasonic Diagnostic Imaging System User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety A2.3.2. TI (Thermal Index) Heating of tissues is caused by absorption of ultrasound when the ultrasound energy is applied. The temperature rise is determined by the acoustic intensity, exposed area and thermophysical properties of the tissue. In order to indicate the potential for temperature rise caused by thermal effects, the AIUM and NEMA formulate thermal index (TI). It is defined as the ratio of the total acoustic power to the acoustic power required to raise the tissue temperature by 1ºC. According to different thermophysical properties of the tissue, TI is divided into three kinds: TIS, TIB and TIC. TIS (Soft Tissue Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise in soft or similar tissues. TIB (Bone Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise when the ultrasound beam passes through soft tissue and a focal region is in the immediate vicinity of bone. TIC (Cranial Bone Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise in the cranial bones or superficial bones. A2.3.3. Display of MI/TI The MI value of this system is lower than 1.0 and it is not displayed. The TI values in the upper right part of the screen. In PW mode, the TI value is displayed and the start point is 0.1. The operator should monitor these values during examinations and keep the exposure time and output level at the minimum amounts needed for effective diagnosis. The display precision is 0.2. Display accuracy of TI is ±50%. A2.4: Acoustic Output A2.4.1. Factors that Contribute to Uncertainty in the Output Display A number of factors should be considered in display accuracy determination methods, such as:  Transducer variability  System variability  Measurement variability and accuracy  The number of operating conditions of which the system is capable and the number tested in obtaining display accuracy results  Whether display accuracy will be determined by specific combinations of system, mode, transducer assembly and transmit patterns, or all allowed combinations of them  Accuracy of system software MI and TI calculation algorithms.  Engineering approximations for real-time calculations CMS 600 plus Digital Ultrasonic Diagnostic Imaging System User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety A2.4.2. Differences between Actual and Displayed MI/TI Actually, many assumptions adopted in the process of measurement and calculations are relatively conservative. Over-estimation of actual in situ intensity exposure, for the majority of tissue paths, is made to the measurement and calculation process. For example, attenuation coefficient of 0.3 dB/cm·MHz, which is much lower than the actual value for most tissues of the body, is adopted. And conservative values of tissue characteristics are selected for use in TI models. Therefore, the display of MI and TI should be used as relative information to assist operator in prudent use of ultrasound system and implementation of ALARA principle, and the values should not be interpreted as the actual physical values in tissues or organs examined. A2.4.3. Measurement Uncertainty The uncertainties in the measurements were predominantly systematic in origin; the random uncertainties were negligible in comparison. The overall systematic uncertainties were determined as follows: 1. Hydrophone Sensitivity: ± 23 percents for intensity, ± 11.5 percents for pressure. Based on the hydrophone calibration report by ONDA. The uncertainty was determined within ±1dB in frequency range 1-15MHz. 2. Digitizer: ±4 percents for intensity. ± 1.5 percents for pressure. Based on the stated accuracy of the 8-bit resolution of the Agilent DSO6012A Digital Oscilloscope and the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement. 3. Temperature: ± 1 percent Based on the temperature variation of the water bath of ± 1 ºC. 4. Spatial Averaging: ± 10 percents for intensity, ± 5 percents for pressure. 5. Non-linear Distortion: N/A. No effects of nonlinear propagation are observed Since all the above error sources are independent, they may be added on an RMS basis, giving a total uncertainty of ± 25.1 percents for all intensity values reported, ± 12.7 percents for all the pressure values and ± 12.6 percents for the Mechanical Index. A2.5: Operator Control Features The possibility of producing mechanical/thermal biological effects can be influenced by three kinds of controls: Direct Controls, Indirect Controls, and Receiver Controls. The qualified operator may use the system controls to minimize the ultrasound output while acquiring necessary clinical information.  Direct Controls The acoustic output of the system can be controlled directly through the level of voltage transmitted. In this case, the maximum acoustic output never exceeds the limits in any mode of operation. CMS 600 plus Digital Ultrasonic Diagnostic Imaging System User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety  Indirect Controls The acoustic output of the system can be controlled indirectly through many imaging parameters, including imaging modes, probe frequency, focus number/position, depth and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The imaging mode determines whether the ultrasound beam is scanning or non-scanning. Thermal bioeffect is closely associated with M, PW and Color mode. Acoustic attenuation of tissue is directly connected to probe frequency. The focus number/position is related to active aperture of probe and beam width. The higher PRF (pulse repetition frequency), the more output pulses occur over a period of time.  Receiver Controls The receiver controls (such as gain, TGC, dynamic range and image processing), which are used to improve image quality, have no effect on acoustic output. Thus these controls should be optimized before increasing acoustic output. It is recommended to use the default (or lowest) output power setting and compensate using Gain control to acquire an image. The default setting is normally around 70% of the allowable power which will not cause any harm to users and is validated to be the most effective for all the transducers. A2.6: Prudent Use Statement Although no confirmed bioeffects on patients caused by exposure from present diagnostic ultrasound equipment have ever been reported, the potential exists that such bioeffects may be identified in the future. Therefore, the ultrasound should be used prudently. High levels of acoustic output and long exposure time should be avoided while acquiring necessary clinical information.
