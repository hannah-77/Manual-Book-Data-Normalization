Place the probe on abdomen with feasible tight contact. The position for listening to fetal heart sounds is different at different gestational weeks. Pregnant mothers can find the correct position based on the gestational week and the fetal heart position chart, select the detection point, press gently for more than 10 seconds, and move the probe gently and slowly in a circular motion on the abdomen. Adjust the probe position to obtain an optimum audio signal. Wait until the sounds is clear and consecutive seconds later, the LCD screen will display the right FHR. Reference map of fetal heart position Figure 4.1 Pocket Fetal Doppler Sonotrax-E Inspect & Record Early stage 12-24 Week, Mid-term 24-32 Week, Later period 32-40 Week. Before 24 weeks, the fetal heartbeat is usually found on the midline of the abdomen and on both sides of it. The shorter the pregnancy, the closer it is to the pubic bone. 24-32 weeks, the fetal heart rate is usually found on the midline of the abdomen or below the left and right sides of the navel. As the fetus grows, the position of the fetal heart rate will also move up. 32-40 weeks, the fetal heart rate is usually found above and below the navel. The fetal heart rate is usually on the other side of the fetal movement position. NOTE: Do not compress probe too tightly on abdomen surface to avoid to weaken signal. NOTE: When searching for the fetal heartbeat, do not pull the probe on the abdominal surface to avoid the NOTE: Do not put the probe on the position where there is strong Placental Blood Sound or strong Umbilical 4.3 FHR Inspecting Finish setting mode and parameters, press power on/off key to start work, press power on/off key again to stop NOTE: Do not measure FHR unless audible and identifiable fetal sound has been heard, usually it needs 5 Pocket Fetal Doppler Sonotrax-E Inspect & Record NOTE: The normal value of the fetal heart rate is 120- 160bpm.100-120bpm and 160-180bpm is the critical values which should be paid some attention to. And lower than 100bpm and more than 180bpm are danger values which should be paid more attention to. 4.4 Adjusting Volume When device is working, you can adjust volume by pressing or key to adjust volume.
