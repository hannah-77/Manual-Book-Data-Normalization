Buku Manual Sonotrax Pro Section 5 Inspecting and Recording 5.1 Inspecting FHR 5.1.1 Gel Usage Daub ultrasonic gel on the probe faceplate to decrease noise and boost up test result. 5.1.2 Finding the Position of Fetus Firstly, please feel the fetal position by hand. Place the working faceplate on abdomen with feasible tight contact. Adjust the probe position to obtain an optimum audio signal. Usually, the heart position of the fetus with small gestational age is on the 1/3 of the line from the umbilicus to symphysis pubis, and with increasing of the gestational age the position will shift upward and deviate to the left or right slightly. NOTE: Do not compress probe too tightly on abdomen surface to avoid to weaken signal and affect the auscultation result. NOTE: When searching for the fetal heartbeat, do not pull the probe on the abdominal surface to avoid the noise. NOTE: Do not put the probe on the position where there is strong Placental Blood Sound(PBS) or strong. 5.1.3 FHR Inspecting Finish setting mode and parameters, press power On/Off key to start work, press power On/Off key again to stop working. NOTE: Do not measure FHR unless audible and identifiable fetal sound has been heard, usually it needs about 5 seconds. NOTE: The normal value of the fetal heart rate is 120-160bpm. 100- 120bpm and 160-180bpm are the critical values which should be paid some attention to. And lower than 100bpm and more than 180bpm are danger values which should be paid more attention to.

Field strengths from fixed RF transmitters, as determined by an electromagnetic site survey, should be less than the compliance level in each frequency range. Interference may occur in the vicinity of equipment marked with the ",
