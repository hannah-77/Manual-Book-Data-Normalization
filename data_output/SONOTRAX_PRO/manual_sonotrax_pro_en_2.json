Place the working faceplate on abdomen with feasible tight contact. Adjust the probe position to obtain an optimum audio signal. Usually, the heart position of the fetus with small gestational age is on the 1/3 of the line from the umbilicus to symphysis pubis, and with increasing of the gestational age the position will shift upward and deviate to the left or right slightly. NOTE: Do not compress probe too tightly on abdomen surface to avoid to weaken signal and affect the auscultation result. NOTE: When searching for the fetal heartbeat, do not pull the probe on the abdominal surface to avoid the noise. NOTE: Do not put the probe on the position where there is strong Placental Blood Sound(PBS) or strong. ",
