    "4.4 Pembersihan": "7.1.1 Cleaning Disconnect the power firstly and clean the shell by a wet cloth or a cotton cloth. Only a little cleaning agent can be added into water which is prepared for the shell cleaning. Liquid, such as organic benzene, ether, benzene and trichloroethylene, can’t be used for cleaning. 7.1.2 Disinfection Use a soft cloth, which is soaked by commonly used water-soluble disinfectant to clean the surface of the shell. Make the disinfectant according to the guidance of the disinfectant manufacturer. Clean the shell carefully in order to avoid any disinfectant seep into the inside of the humidifier. Do not use any organic solvent to clean the shell. 7.2 Components of Humidification Chamber and Adapters 7.2.1 Removing and Replacement of Components 1. Removing of Humidification Chamber Shut down the humidifier and remove the breathing circuits connected with the humidification chamber; Press the front retainer of the chamber then remove the chamber from the humidifier by pushing it forward. 2. Removing Humidification Bottle Press and push the bottom to remove the upper cover (see the following drawing); Put an absorbent paper into the absorbent paper bracket following to the drawing; Put the bracket back to its former place; Reassemble the upper cover on the humidification bottle. 3. Replacing Washer of the Upper Cover Remove the upper cover and absorbent paper bracket; Pull the washer out and replace a new one; Reassemble all the components. 4. Replacing O-Ring of the Heated Tray Remove the heated tray from humidification chamber and dismantle the O-Ring; Put the O-Ring into the seal groove of heated tray and press it in to the groove Reassemble the heated tray on the humidification chamber. ATTENTION : It’s wrong to disinfect the humidification chamber when all the components of the chamber are assembled as a whole. 7.2.2 Disinfecting ◆ Ensure the surface of heater plate is clean and free from pitting, gouging which may be cleaned by using a moist cloth.Cleaning liquid should be prevented from entering the equipment which may damage the device. ◆ The chamber and connectors can be disinfected with 1:500 chlorine-containing disinfectant for 30 minutes. Do not sterilize adaptors fitted together, or on chambers. The chambers and adaptors can not be autoclavable. 7.2.3 Power Cable The power cable should be clean by a wet cloth and soft brush after use. Do not use any sharp things or solvent for plastics for cleaning. The power cable should be disinfected by a device-disinfectant impregnated cloth. It can’t be impregnated into cleaning agent, or be steamed or boiled. WARNING: Maintain the temperature sensor and heater wire adapter dry. SECTION 8 ERROR CODES MANUAL Access the Working Menu by pressing the mute and mode buttons together for 1 second, the display should show two rows of dashes ‘= = =’. Releasing both buttons will allow the Working Menu to cycle automatically until “End” shown on diisplay. Enter “LFS” function by pushing Mute Button to recognize the error, the error codes shown Error Description of Fault E00 No fault E01 Disconnect temperature sensor E02 “POWER ON/OFF” button is stuck E03 “MODE” button is stuck E04 “MUTE” button is stuck E05 5volts and 9volts D.C. Power supply malfunction E06 Disconnect heater wire E08 Low temperature of lung E09 Heater plate sensor faulty E10 Disconnect 22V or fuse is blown E11 RL2 relay or Q10 TRIAC is open circuit E12 RL2 relay or Q10 TRIAC is short circuit E13 High temperature alarming at output of chamber E14 High temperature alarming at patients end E16 Disconnect chamber temperature sensor E17 Disconnect airway temperature sensor SECTION 9 WORKING MENU Access the Working Menu by pressing the mute and mode buttons together for 1 second, the display should show two rows of dashes ‘= = =’. Releasing both buttons will allow the Working Menu to cycle automatically until “End” shown on display. Display Description HC Humidity Compensation (HC) algorithm Note: HC is inactive while operating under non-heater wire control. Invasive mode, compensation range is 0.0 to 5.0℃ (CSP = 37.0 to 42℃) Non-Invasive mode, the compensation range is 0.0 to 5.0℃ (CSP = 31.0 By pressing the Mute and Mode buttons together for 1 second or pressing the Mute and Power buttons together for 1 second the user can respectively move up or down through the settings listed below. The humidifier will confirm the change with a double beep. ‘5.0’ = +5.0℃ of chamber compensation‘4.0’= +4.0℃ of chamber compemsation ‘3.0’ = +3.0℃ of chamber compensation‘2.0 = +2.0℃ of chamber compensation ‘1.0’ = +1.0℃ of chamber compensation Cct Connected breathing circuit identification: “S“ = Standard heater wire adapter connected “---” = No heaters detected while under heater wire control Non-Heater Wire Operation To enable non-heater wire operation, press and hold both the mute and mode buttons simultaneously for 1 second. The display will show ‘nhh’ and the humidifier will confirm with an audible beep. Ensure that no heated breathing circuit is connected to the humidifier otherwise the humidifier won’t change operation. To disable non-heater wire mode, repeat the above process or connect a heater breathing circuit CSP Chamber set point, in 0.1℃ resolution eg. Invasive mode range 37.0℃ to 42.0℃. Non-Invasive mode range 31.0℃ to 36.0℃. Cdc Chamber Duty Cycle (%) CHP Chamber Power / Flow ratio (W/LPM) HP Heater Plate Temperature (1℃) Flo Gas Flow Rate (0.1 LPM) “---“ = Unknown Flow (flow measurement not started) FLr Gas Flow Rate Range: “---“ = Unknown Flow (flow measurement not started) “no” = No flow, ( Stand-by ) “Lo” = Low flow, ( < 3 LPM ) “In” = Intermediate flow, ( 2 to 17 LPM ) “Hi” = High flow, ( > 13 LPM ) “ - ” = Ventilated flow detected ASP Airway temperature set point (0.1℃) Adc Airway Duty Cycle (%) H2O Water out number, used to detect the presence of chamber water, calculated from, chamber power / (heater plate temp. – chamber temp.). During selection of this menu the water out indicator will light if the water out number falls below a dry chamber threshold. LAS Last Alarm State, the display will blank, and the humidifier’s last alarm will be shown on the indicators. To clear LAS, press and hold the mute and mode buttons for 1 second. The humidifier will beep when LAS has been cleared. LFS Last Fault State, refer to section 6.3. To clear LFS, press and hold the mute and mode buttons for 1 second. The humidifier will beep when LFS has been cleared. SoF Software version End Press the mute button to cycle to the start of the menu, or the diagnostic menu will automatically exit after 6 seconds. SECTION 10 MATTER NEEDING ATTENTION 10.1 Maintenance Maintain and inspect the humidifier and its accessories timely to make sure the surfaces of heating tray and heated tray are clean and no-wearing. The surface of heating tray could be clean by wet cloth and be wiped by soft dry cloth. 10.2 Environmental Protection Humidifier is an auxiliary humidification and heating device of ventilator. It has a certain service life like other medical devices. When the part is determined to be scrapped, please replace it in time. 10.3 Humidification Chamber The humidification chambers could be infected by special virus since it is connected with the patient's respiratory track directly. Discarding the untreated waste or residue of the used chambers carelessly could bring pollution to the surrounding environment. Therefore, the used chambers and material in the chambers must be sent to a qualified company for treatment in accordance with the hospital process after properly cleaning and disinfecting. 10.4 Respiratory Humidifier Respiratory humidifiers should be sent to a qualified company in accordance with the scrap sequence of electronic products and the hospital process for treatment after properly cleaning and disinfecting. 10.5 Transportation and Storage Conditions Environmental temperature: - 40℃～55℃ Relative humidity: not higher than 93% Atmospheric pressure: 500hpa～1060hpa Should be stored in a well-ventilated room without corrosive gases ATTENTION: The equipment shall be packed in accordance with the requirements of a contract. Appropriate icons and logos should be attached on the package. Avoid violent vibration during transit. The humidifier should be kept in the operation room for more than 8 hours before being used when the humidifier was stored in improper environment. RESPIRATORY HUMIDIFIER Manual Book ",
