Experience in Use and Maintenance The operating habits and maintenance levels of the operator not only affect the service life of the device, but also directly relate to the quality of the detected waveform and diagnostic quality. Through the problems encountered by technical engineers in the process of installation and maintenance, we have accumulated a lot of experience to share with you. The amplitude of brain waves measured by EEG products is very low, generally around tens of microvolts, which is a weak signal. So whether in the installation or maintenance process, first check the following 1. The surrounding environment and the location of the device. The device should be installed in a quiet environment, away from physiotherapy room that generating X-ray or ultra-short wave, substation, construction site and large mechanical room. Considering the convenience of use, choose the location close to neurology clinic or ward. In a high-rise building, it is recommended to install the device on the second or third floor. In addition, the device should be placed in a cool and dry place, and keep the room clean. Do not put it EEG-32 Electroencephalograph User Manual Precautions under the window or near radiator to prevent heat and moisture. It is better to equip with air conditioning facilities in the EEG room. 2. Ground wire. The Brain Electric Activity Mapping is a sophisticated electronic instrument that requires a good ground wire to ensure the normal operation of the device and personal safety. A special ground wire should be used, usually, it is a copper rod with a diameter of 1.0 ~ 1.5cm, or a copper plate with a size of 40cm*40cm and a thickness of 2 ~ 4mm buried in the underground of 1.0 ~ 1.5m deep. Place some water-absorbing substances (such as charcoal) and salt around it to reduce the electrical resistivity of the soil, and keep the ground wire in good contact with the land. The other end of the ground wire is tightly welded to a thick steel wire of 80 ~ 100cm, and then connected to the casing of the device. After the device is grounded, use a grounding resistance tester to check whether the grounding resistance meets the requirement (less than 4Ω). If it exceeds the specified value, re-install and debug the ground wire. 3. Power supply. The power supply of the EEG room should be supplied by a dedicated line from the power distribution room to obtain stable voltage during using. 4. Patient. Before the EEG examination, the clinician should have a detailed understanding of the patient’s relevant information and medication. Critically ill patient should be accompanied by a special person for the induction experiment. Excessive scalp oil and large resistance on scalp electrode often lead to low brain wave amplitude and big interference. Therefore, it is recommended to wash patient’s hair before the examination. Low blood sugar can also affect the EEG results, do not fasting, and the examination is appropriate after three hours of eating. 5. Electrodes. The electrodes should be placed in strict accordance with the international 10- 20 system. Patient’s hair should be parted to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the scalp. If the waveform is asymmetrical left and right, and the waveform on one side appears abnormal and large interference, first check the placement of the ear electrode on corresponding side. 6. Communication cable. Check the communication cable when data communication fails. If there is any problem, replace the communication cable. 7. User should properly dispose of the scrapped products and packaging materials following the local laws and regulations, and try to support the classification and recycling. 8. The schematic diagram and component list related to the device can only be provided to the qualified service station or maintenance staff approved by our company. The maintenance personnel is responsible for maintaining our device. EEG-32 Electroencephalograph User Manual Precautions  Do not run other programs during waveform gathering, and close the floating windows (such as input method window) to avoid affecting the waveform gathering.  When not all leads are connected: All lead cables should be connected to the corresponding lead in the gathering. If only some of the leads are necessary, please be sure to short all unconnected lead cables by metal wires, and then connect with the GND to eliminate the interference signals introduced by the unconnected lead cables. At the same time, the unconnected lead should be closed in the software correspondingly (click the lead name on the right side of the waveform, the waveform of this lead turns to a straight line), in order to prevent its fluctuation from affecting other leads.
