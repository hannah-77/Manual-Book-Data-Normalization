Product Introduction Welcome to the introduction of HRA Portable-01. Utilizing the low-voltage direct- current (DC) stimulus response technique, the HRA Portable-01 sends low-voltage DC stimulus signals to 22 body parts, obtains the electrical conduction value between electrodes, and records the instant electrophysiological status of the examinee. HRA Portable-01 is composed of the console (laptop, data acquisition unit with hand and foot electrodes installed), disposable head electrodes, head electrodes cable, hand electrodes and leg electrodes connector cable, and power adaptor. B. Software Version Complete version of software: V1.0 Release version of software: V1 Naming rule of software version: V X.X Minor version update Major version update C. Working Principle Using the low-voltage DC stimulus response technique, the HRA system alternately sends the low-voltage (1.3 V) DC stimulus signal to 22 body parts at the mean frequency of 255 times/3seconds through 6 symmetrical electrodes at the head, the hand and the foot. This signal is turned into the ion current in the tissue. The electrical conductivity is obtained according to the polarization movement of the ion current in the skin tissue between the negative and the positive pole. The intensity change of 22 body parts/paths is recorded after stimulus signals are sent. D. Intended Use The device is for the measurement of galvanic skin response. E.
