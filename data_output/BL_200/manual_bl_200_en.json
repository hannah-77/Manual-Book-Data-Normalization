Product life: 6 years. 2. Production date: See product label. 2. Working principle The phototherapy instrument is equipped with upper and lower blue light sources: the lower blue light acts on the surface of the baby's skin through transparent plexiglass; the upper blue light directly acts on the surface of the baby's skin. The distance between the upper blue light source and the baby can be adjusted by the adjustment frame, and then the irradiance can be adjusted, and the lower blue light can be used to achieve a higher therapeutic effect. When the LED lamps of the upper and lower light sources emit blue light for treatment, they also produce a certain amount of heat radiation (about 2°C higher than the working environment temperature after the warm-up is stabilized). The upper and lower light sources have independent control parts. The medical staff can choose the appropriate irradiation mode and timing method according to the clinical needs, and check the baby's body temperature regularly to safely and effectively treat neonatal jaundice.

The working status of the upper blue LED lamp beads After turning on, use the irradiation intensity adjustment button to observe whether the number of corresponding LED lamp beads is in accordance with the description in 4.1 when in the high, medium and low 7 Precautions 7.2 Can only be used by appropriately trained personnel and qualified medical personnel who are familiar with the existing known risks and benefits of using the equipment 7.3 The use of phototherapy equipment may affect the patient's body temperature. It is necessary to measure the patient's body temperature; phototherapy may also affect the water balance of some patients. In order to prevent patients from being dehydrated, appropriate supplementary fluids are required. 7.4 The distance between the upper blue light and the effective surface is adjustable. When the distance is shortened, the power density of blue light irradiation will increase, but it will also increase the temperature of the radiation area. Therefore, a suitable radiation distance must be selected; it is recommended to keep the distance between the baby mattress and the upper blue light Between 410mm and 570mm. 7.5 The use of phototherapy equipment in thermotherapy devices (such as incubators, radiation heaters, heating mattresses) increases the amount of heat supply, which will affect the patient's body temperature and may increase the patient's body temperature. Therefore, when performing phototherapy, the temperature of the child must be measured regularly. 7.6 When using infant incubators, infant radiant warmers or heated mattresses, it is recommended to use the infant skin control mode. Otherwise, according to the body temperature measurement result, the setting value of the air temperature in the incubator or the setting of the heat output of the radiant warmer or the setting of the heat output of the heated mattress must be reduced. 7.7 The service life of the LED lamp beads is 50000 hours. When the cumulative work of the lamp beads reaches the expected life, all the LED lamp beads must be replaced to ensure the treatment effect. When replacing the lamp beads, the special LED lamp beads designated by the manufacturer must be used, otherwise the safety and effectiveness of the phototherapy equipment will be affected. 7.8 The maintenance period of LED lamp beads is 2 months, to ensure that all LED lamp beads are replaced after the total bilirubin irradiance has attenuated by 25%. 7.9 As the distance between the phototherapy equipment and the effective surface increases, the average value of total bilirubin irradiance will decrease; as the distance decreases, the average value of total irradiance will increase. The figure below shows the irradiance curve with a wavelength range of 320nm to 550nm and an interval of 5nm. 7.10 The calibration curve of the blue radiometer for measuring the total irradiance of bilirubin is shown in the figure below.

After the expiration date, if discarded randomly, it will cause damage to the local environment. Therefore, it must be disposed of in accordance with local laws or returned to our company for disposal. 7.19 he brake casters must be locked during use to prevent the equipment from moving; after selecting the appropriate radiation distance and radiation angle, the threaded handle must be tightened to prevent the light box from turning or moving up and down. 7.20 The surface of the lens must be cleaned frequently; if used with an incubator, the plexiglass on the top of the infant compartment should be kept clear to ensure the effect of phototherapy. 7.21 Only the parts designated by our company (including adapters and LED lamp beads) can be used for product maintenance, otherwise the safety and effectiveness of the equipment will be affected. 7.22 For neonates suffering from severe jaundice, phototherapy should be combined with drugs, or even combined with exchange blood therapy, to prevent the unsatisfactory effect of phototherapy alone from affecting the treatment of children. 7.23 When observing the baby's skin color for diagnosis, a white light source should be used to prevent the use of blue light from affecting the skin color observation. 7.24 Do not use it in an environment with portable and mobile radio frequency communication equipment, so as not to affect the normal operation of the product. 7.25 This equipment is only used for blue light irradiation treatment and does not have the function of heat preservation. An opaque curtain can be used to shield the equipment for protection and also have a certain warmth for the patient. The shielding will affect the care and observation of the child by the nursing staff. It is recommended to increase the frequency of monitoring children, and if necessary, keep the transparent observation window for real-time observation. 8.2 Selama fototerapi, mata anak-anak harus ditutup dengan kain hitam buram atau kacamata harus dipakai untuk menghindari kerusakan pada retina pasien selama penerangan.

Summary Jaundice is a common phenomenon in neonatal period, it is observed that Jaundice is a common phenomenon in neonatal period, it is observed that over 90% newborn babies have jaundice in different degree. It can be over 90% newborn babies have jaundice in different degree. It can be a physiological phenomenon (physiological jaundice) in neonatal period, or it can be an important symptom of many diseases in neonatal period (called pathological jaundice. This pathological jaundice can cause bilirubin brain illness (called kernicterus), it can cause brain damage of newborn baby, and results in early death and serious sequela, so we must take immediate and efficient measures to treat neonatal pathological jaundice. The effect of phototherapy treatment for neonatal high bilirubin blood illness has been approved by clinic, its principle is that bilirubin can absorb rays to have actinic isomerization, it makes the indirect bilirubin oxidize into one water-soluble product under the bluish green light (light-oxidation bilirubin).
