    "2.0 Instalasi": "2.4 Installation 1. When installation the ground should be smooth. 2. Before installation and use, take down all the fixing devices of the product. 3. To avoid the damage caused by the non-normal situation or to ensure the safety of the user, the electric supply should have a very good grounding system. 4. The electric power jack should meet the electric rating, have a good grounding, and can not have situations where the jack reed is not complete or start, which is to avoid the situations of bad connector fire. 5. The rating of the electric power supply wires should be on speaking terms with the maximum electric current of the product, which avoids the suddenness caused by the heat of the power wire for a long time. 6. When using the product should have a good ventilation environment, can not use the product when the air is in condition of combustibility or causticity 7. Make sure the product can work for a long time, high efficiently, and stably, should clean the filter on time (suggest one week) 8. If the medical Air Compressor has not been used for a long time, it should be stored in conditions of a temperature of -10℃～+40℃, relative humidity not more than 80%、atmospheric pressure of 500hPa～1060hPa, no causticity air and good ventilation inside room. 2.5 Construction The indicator light, button, and pressure meter are as follows: ① Control panel ③ Support frame ④ Flexible casters ⑤ Air intake filter ⑥ Cooling system ⑦ Oil-mist separator ⑨ Hours meter ⑩ Net power input/output port 2.6 Operation process 1. Get on the electric power, open the control switch, and then the indicator light shines; the compression pump, cooling system (fan), freezing system, and hours meter should be able to work properly. 2. The pressure meter will go up slowly, which shows the pressure will be stable in the scope of 0.3MPa～0.4MPa. 3. The automatic drainage system works, and the pressure meter indicates the pressure is stable; the vent exhausts freely, which shows the product works normally, and then can work with the matched products. 4. When stopping, please turn off the electric power switch, turn off the web power, and remove the air and water from the whole tube. Capability Examine 3.1 Whole machine examine Connect correctly, put on the electric power switch, and the indicator light shines which shows the product is in work condition. The pressure can be from “0” and go up stable to 0.3～0.4MPa (used pressure), then show the pump can be able to work properly. Note： According to different matched oxygen sources, the output pressure can be adjustable. When the pressure is lower than 0.2MPa, please maintain in time. 3.2 Cold system and freezing system examine When put your hand on the bottom air exists, if there is hot airflow from the box, then shows the fans work normally. The cooling fan and refrigeration chips should work normally when the cooling system working. Note: when the cold system has a problem, should stop immediately and then be used after well maintained. It will cause cooling failure when cooling the fan for the cooling system with failure, long hours are likely to freeze. Device with automatic deicing function 3.3 Electric power examine Put on power, when the indicator light shines stable, then show the power is got through well. 3.4 Automatic exhaust examine When gets on power, the pressure meter goes up and then goes down, and can show stably within the normal scope, then show the overflow valve works normally. Troubleshooting Problem Reasonable cause Solve measure Pressure on the high side 1. The decompress system, 1. Adjust relevant pressure or on the low side Pressure system are not 2. Examine or replace the adjusted properly pressure meter 2. Is The pressure meter 3. Examine or replace the damaged or big tolerance connecting pipe 3. The pipe breaks or loose off. Pressure meter no 1. Electric power off, fuse 1. Examine the power or pressure break. replace the same 2. Compressor pump does not specification fuse work 2. Examine the compressor 3. Pipe damaged or broken pump or power 4. Overheat protect as the too- 3. Examine the connecting high temperature pipe 4. Check if it is whether overheats or not, the blower whether works or Water on the high side 1. Drainage System failure 1. Replace or adjust 2. Improper adjustment 2. Check the adjustment of 3. Cooling system failure the pressure 3. Check cooling system Pressure gauge showing 1. Decompress system wall up 1. Clean up decompress the pressure but no gas 2. Output way wall up valve output 2. Check the connect or output way The compress pump 1. Electric power supply off, 1. Check the power supply cannot start up voltage too low 2. Check the power supply 2. The compress pump does 3. Replace compress pump not supply electric power 4. Check fuse/ switch 3. The compress pump has a 4. Fuse/switch fault 1. When the Medical Air Compressor arrives, should take off the package to check the whole machine and examine whether it is damaged or not. 2. Check whether all the parts are complete or not. 3. Take down the fixing parts according to the mark or instructions, then use them. 4. After using it for some time, should clean and maintain the Medical Air Compressor. (Suggest clean once a week). 5. Supply service and maintenance for free within one year after the product is sold, (can supply maintenance for the product all life). 5.2 Normal working conditions, Transport and storage conditions Location of a supply system 5.2.1 Normal working conditions Environment temperature：- 5℃～40℃ Relative humidity: Not more than 80% Atmospheric pressure: 860hpa～1060hpa Used power pressure: a.c.220V±22V, 50Hz±1Hz 5.2.2 Transport and storage conditions Environment temperature: - 40℃～55℃ Relative humidity: Not more than 93% Atmospheric pressure: 500hpa～1060hpa Should store in the inside room of no causticity air and good ventilation. The transport packing will be according to the contract requirement and have a proper picture or mark, transportation avoids rattling. 5.2.3 Location of Supply Systems Gas and non-cryogenic liquid cylinder supply systems shall not be located in the same room as medical air compressors, oxygen concentrators, or vacuum supply systems. The location of supply systems shall take into account potential hazards (e.g. contamination and fires) arising from the location of other equipment or other supply systems within the same room These locations shall be provided with drainage facilities. The ambient temperature in rooms for supply systems shall be in the range of 10℃ to 40℃. MEDICAL AIR COMPRESSOR Manual Book ",
