SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Alarms Chapter 4 Alarms 4.1 Alarms Classification The monitor has two types of alarm: patient alarm and technical alarm. Patient alarms indicate the situation of vital sign exceeding its configured limit. Audible alarms and visual alarms can be disabled. The adjustable alarm limits determine the conditions that trigger the alarm. They can be disabled. Technical alarms indicate that the monitor cannot measure and therefore cannot detect critical patient conditions reliably. They cannot be disabled. The alarms have two levels: medium and low. Medium level alarm is a serious warning, whose symbol is **; low level alarm is a general warning. The medium level alarms have higher priority than the low level alarms. If both types of alarms are active at the same time, the monitor sounds an audible indicator for the medium level alarms. The system sets all alarm levels, and you cannot change them. 4.2 Audible Alarm If the audible alarm is not disabled, the alarm indicator displays . When an alarm is active, the monitor gives out a sound. (The sound pressure range is 45dB ~ 85dB.) Medium level alarm: a ―Do‖ tone is repeated three times, and then pauses for 5 seconds. Low level alarm: a ―Do‖ tone is issued, and then pauses for 20 seconds. Press the SILENCE key , the audible alarm toggles between on and off (temporarily or infinitely, you can change the setting). If the audible alarm is temporarily disabled, the alarm indicator displays , with a remaining time on the right. When the time is out, the audible alarm is enabled again automatically. If the audible alarm is infinitely disabled, the alarm indicator displays , which is flashing in the manner of lighting for one second and pausing for one second. It will not be enabled again until the SILENCE key is pressed. However, the alarm messages will still be displayed and the alarm indicator will still be lighted up when an alarm is active. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Alarms 1 Do not rely exclusively on the audible alarm system for patient monitoring. Adjustment of alarm volume to a low level or off during patient monitoring may result in patient danger. Remember that the most reliable method of patient monitoring combines close personal surveillance with correct operation of monitoring equipment. 2 When the sound pressure of audible alarm is equivalent to the ambient noise, it may be difficult for the operator to distinguish the audible alarm. 4.3 Visual Alarm When an alarm is active, - Alarm indicator: the alarm indicator lights up. Alarm Category Indicator Color Flashing Frequency Duty Cycle Medium level alarm yellow 0.4Hz to 0.8Hz 20% to 60% on Low level alarm yellow Constant (on) 100% on - Alarm message: the alarm message appears in the alarm message area of the main interface in - Flashing numeric: the numeric of the measurement flashes in grey with a frequency of 2Hz. When more than one alarm of the same level is active, the alarm messages appear in the same area in succession. When more than one alarm of different levels are active, only the alarms of the highest level are displayed in the message window. The patient alarm messages are displayed either:  in text form, for example ―** FHR2 LOW‖; or  in numeric form, for example ―** FHR2 115 < 120‖; ** indicates this is a medium level alarm event; the first number is the current measurement result; the second number is the preset alarm limit. The technical alarm messages are displayed in text form, for example ―Fetus EQUIP MALF‖. Setting alarm limits to extreme values may cause the alarm system to become ineffective. It is recommended to use the default settings. 4.4 *Choosing Alarm Silence Duration You can choose the alarm silence duration, SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Alarms 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > Silence Duration. 3 Select Infinite (default), 1 min, 2 min or 3 min. 4 Select OK. 4.5 Choosing Alarm Message Form You can change the patient alarm display form, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > Message Form. 3 Select Text (default) or Numeric. 4 Select OK. 4.6 Changing Alarm Volume You can change the alarm volume, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > Alarm Volume. 3 Select Low (default), Medium or High. 4 Select OK. 4.7 Choosing Signal Loss Delay When the fetal signal is lost and this condition continues for a certain time, the monitor issues a technical alarm.

The monitor can display a maximum of 100 immediate alarm messages. When the storage is full, it will delete the earliest alarm message automatically to store the new one. Select the alarm reviewing key in the SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Alarms message window to open this menu. Each page displays 10 alarm records. The page mark ―1/1‖ informs you that there is 1 page and the present one is page 1. You can select the alarm list and then rotate the control knob to review more alarms. When the monitor is switched off, the power supply is cut off accidentally, or a new monitoring starts, the immediate alarm messages will be cleared. 4.9 Alarm Treatment Measures When the monitor gives out an alarm and catches your attention, you should: - Recognize which functional parameter alarms or what the alarm is. - Check the patient’s condition. - Identify the cause of the alarm. - Silence the alarm if necessary. Check if the alarm is terminated when the alarm condition is solved. 4.10 Testing Alarms To test the functions of visible and audible alarms, do the following: 1 Switch on the monitor. 2 Enable the alarm. 3 Set the alarm limits to a small range. 4 Stimulate a signal that is higher than the high alarm limit or lower than the low alarm limit. Or disconnect one of the plugs. 5 Verify if the visible and audible alarms are working properly. 4.11 Patient Alarm Defaults Alarm Setting Options Default FHR1/FHR2 Alarm On, Off On FHR1/FHR2 Low alarm limit 60 bpm ~ 205 bpm, in increments of 5 120 bpm FHR1/FHR2 High alarm limit 65 bpm ~ 210 bpm, in increments of 5 160 bpm FHR1/FHR2 Alarm Delay 0 ~ 20 second(s), in increments of 5 10 seconds FHR1/FHR2 Alarm Level Medium, not adjustable Medium SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Alarms The high alarm limit must be higher than the low alarm limit. When setting the high alarm limit, you do not have access to the options that are lower than the preset low alarm limit, and vice versa. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Printing Chapter 5 Printing 5.1 *Function Description The built-in thermal recorder applied in the monitor supports both the American and international standard wide recorder paper. It prints continuous traces synchronously along with marks. The monitor supports some other functions listed below:  Auto start printing: If the function is enabled, the recorder starts printing automatically when a new monitoring starts (the START key is pressed). Otherwise you have to press the PRINT key to start printing.  Printing timer: The printing timer determines the elapsed time for each print. This time is adjustable. Refer to 5.2.3 Changing the Print Timer.  Fast printing: The recorder prints the data saved in the monitor at a high speed (up to  Data Caching: When the paper drawer runs out of paper or when it is open, the recorder stops printing. The data from this time on (at most 60 minutes) will be temporarily saved in the internal memory. When new paper is loaded and/or the drawer is closed, the saved data will be printed out at a high speed. After the saved trace has been printed out, the recorder switches back to printing the current data at the normal speed automatically. When the monitor is switched off, the data in the internal memory will be lost.  FHR2 offset: You can set the offset of the FHR2 trace to separate the two fetal heart traces on the screen and the recorder paper. Refer to 7.3.4 Changing FHR2/DFHR Offset.  Print self-check: The recorder prints a baseline for self checking when the monitor is switched on.  Paper advance: When printing stops, the paper advances to the next perforation, making it easy to be torn off. Refer to 5.2.5 Switching Paper Advance On or Off. 5.2 Printing Configuration All the parameters should be well configured before printing starts. You cannot change the configuration in the process of printing.

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Pre-Monitoring Preparation Chapter 6 Pre-Monitoring Preparation 6.1 Confirming Fetal Life Fetal monitoring with ultrasound or DECG can not differentiate a fetal heart rate signal source from a maternal heart rate source in all situations. These are some of the signal sources that might be taken as FHR signal source by mistake: - High maternal heart rate signal. - Maternal aorta or other large vessels signals. - Electrical impulse from the maternal heart transmitted through a recently deceased fetus. - Movement of the deceased fetus during or following maternal movement. So you need to confirm fetal life by other means before starting to use the fetal monitor, such as using a fetoscope, stethoscope, Pinard stethoscope or obstetric ultrasonography. 6.2 Switching On 1 Check if all the metal parts are linked to the protective earth cord and the cord is in good condition before switching on the monitor. 2 If any sign of damage is detected, or the monitor displays some error messages, do not use it on any patient. Contact biomedical engineer in the hospital or our service engineer immediately. Press the POWER switch on the front panel to switch on the monitor. The power indicator lights up and a start-up music will be heard. You can operate the monitor after the main interface You can choose to switch the start-up music on or off, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select General > Start-up Music. 3 Select ON (default) or OFF. 4 Select OK. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Pre-Monitoring Preparation 6.3 Checking Recorder Paper The monitor provides the print self-check function to check if the recorder paper is correctly loaded and set. The recorder prints a baseline after start-up (if Print Self-Check in the menu is ON). Observe the starts and ends of the printed baselines (illustrated with the arrow). The starts and ends should be printed exactly on the edges of the pane if the recorder paper is correctly loaded and set. If they do not comply with the edges, reload paper or ask the service engineer to check the paper settings of the monitor. If the monitor does not print the baseline, switch on the Print Self-Check and then restart the Make sure the paper is correctly loaded before starting printing. 6.4 Setting Date and Time You can change the date and time of the monitor, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Date And Time. 3 From left to right, the figures are used to set the year, month, date, hour, minute and 4 Select Date Format for the format of the date; there are three options: yyyy-mm-dd (default), mm/dd/yyyy and dd/mm/yyyy. 5 Select OK. 1 You should set date and time information in advance. After this information is changed, the monitor starts new monitoring with an auto ID. Therefore, we advise you to restart the monitor after changing date or time information, and do not perform this operation when monitoring is in process. 2 If date and time cannot be saved, it is probably the battery has reached the end of its service life. Please contact the service personnel or your local distributor. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Pre-Monitoring Preparation 6.5 Adjusting Volume The monitor automatically detects which channel the ultrasound transducer is connected to.

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Pre-Monitoring Preparation 6.6 Relocation of the Transducers Transducers may be belted on the patient for a long time without stop. In rare cases, this may lead to irritations to the patient skin. To avoid skin irritations, please inspect the application site at least every three hours. If the skin quality changes, you should move the transducer to another site. US transducers need to change application site frequently to track fetal heart. It is normal during a monitoring process. But TOCO transducers are different. Please periodically inspect the application site (between contractions) of TOCO transducer at least every three hours. To reduce the risk of skin irritations, do not allow residual cleaning agent or disinfecting agent on the surface of transducers. Before using cleaning agent and/or disinfecting agent, refer to the cleaning and disinfecting sections in this user manual. Wipe the transducer surface with a cloth dampened with water before applying to the patient. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring Chapter 7 Fetal Monitoring 1 The monitor is intended for use in antenatal care room, predelivery room and delivery room, but not for use in intensive care units (ICU), operating rooms or for home use. 2 The monitor is not protected against defibrillation. Do not apply it during electro-surgery or MRI; otherwise it might result in harming the patient or the operator. 3 Always check if the alarm settings are appropriate for your patient before starting monitoring. 7.1 Monitoring FHR with Ultrasound The ultrasound monitoring is a method to obtain FHR on maternal abdominal wall. Place a US transducer (Ultrasound transducer) on maternal abdomen. It transmits low energy ultrasound wave to the fetal heart, and receives the echo signal. 1 Make sure you have confirmed the fetal life by other means before using this monitor for FHR monitoring. 2 FHR should not be monitored until a clear fetal heart signal is detected. 3 If FHR reduces more than 10 bpm suddenly, or the beat of fetal heart sounds slower abruptly, please check if it is the MHR that is being monitored by the transducer. If so, relocate the transducer for the best fetal heart signal. 4 The sphere of activity for the fetus is much larger during mid-trimester of gestation (from 24th week to 28th week). When fetal heart moves away from the US transducer, please redetermine the fetal heart position and relocate the transducer. 5 Inspect patient skin before applying the transducer for monitoring. If the skin quality is poor, especially when the skin is damaged or irritated, please change a site to apply the transducer. It is recommended to start printing FHR trace after clear fetal heart signal is detected and FHR computing has stabilized. 7.1.1 Parts Required 1) US transducer 2) Aquasonic coupling gel 3) Belt SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 7.1.2 FHR Monitoring Procedure 1) Placing Transducer Belt Place the transducer belts across the bed, ensuring that the belt will be around the abdomen when it is fastened. Lay the patient on the bed. Alternatively, the patient can take a sitting position. Arrange the belt around her abdomen. 2) Determining the Transducer Position - Determine the fetal position using Leopold’s maneuvers. - Search for the location of the fetal heart using a stethoscope or a fetoscope. The best fetal heart signal can be obtained through the fetal back. - Place the transducer above the navel for head presentation and place the transducer below the navel for breech presentation. Fetal Heart Early Parturition Late Parturition Figure 7-1 Positioning Ultrasound Transducer (single fetus) - During parturition, the fetal heart moves downward as the labor progresses. It is recommended to move the transducer along with the fetus. 3) Acquiring Fetal Heart Signal Apply a certain amount of acoustic gel on the transducer and move the transducer slowly around the fetus site to even the gel. The best fetal heart signal can be obtained through the fetal back. Find at least 2 or 3 sites, and choose the one where the clearest, most sonorous and steady fetal heart sound is heard. When the transducer is connected correctly and communicated well, the fetal heart signal indicator is full. If the signal is poor, the signal indicator shows as it is and no FHR data are displayed. When you move the transducer on the abdomen, adjust the speaker volume so that it can be clearly heard. 4) Fixing the Transducer Wrap the abdomen with the belt over the transducer. Fix the transducer by pushing its buckle through the overlapping section of the belt. Make sure the belt fits the patient snugly but comfortably. Meanwhile, fetus heart beat sound is heard; the FHR trace and numeric are displayed on the screen. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 5) Confirming that the Fetus is the Signal Source Ultrasound Doppler technology is utilized to observe the fetal heart rate externally, there are possibilities that maternal heart rate signal is mistaken for FHR signal. It is highly recommended to confirm that the fetus is the signal source continuously. You can feel the maternal pulse at the same time. If the maternal heart signal is misidentified as the fetal heart signal, Repositioning of the transducer is needed. 1 Do not mistake the high maternal heart rate for fetal heart rate. The fetal pulse can be distinguished from the maternal pulse by feeling the mother’s pulse during the examination. 2 The best quality records will only be obtained if the probe is placed in the optimum position. Positions with strong placental sounds or umbilical blood flow sound should be avoided. 3 If the fetus is in the cephalic presentation and the mother is supine, the clearest heart sound will normally be found on the midline below the umbilicus. During monitoring, the pregnant woman’s prolonged lying in the supine position should be avoided owing to the possibility of supine hypotension. Sitting up or lateral positions are preferable and may be more comfortable. 4 During long-time monitoring, the gel may dry out as the transducer moves around. Add more gel in time if it is inadequate. 5 When applied to the patient, the ultrasound transducer may warm slightly (less than 2°C (3.6ºF) above ambient temperature). When NOT applied, at the ambient temperature of 40°C (104ºF), the ultrasound transducer may reach the highest temperature of 43°C (109.4ºF). 7.1.3 Switching the FHR Alarm On or Off You can choose to switch the FHR alarm on or off. If the fetal heart alarm is switched off, the monitor will no longer give any audible or visual warning for this monitoring item. 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > FHR > Alarm. 3 Select ON (default) or OFF. 4 Select OK. If FHR alarm is switched off, an alarm switched-off symbol will appear in the alarm message area on the main interface. For example: SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring Do not switch the alarm off for the condition where the patient’s safety maybe endangered. 7.1.4 Changing FHR Alarm Limits You can change the FHR alarm limits. The alarm limits you set determine the conditions that trigger the alarm. 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > FHR. 3 Select a value from 60 ~ 205 for low alarm limit. 4 Select a value from 65 ~ 210 for high alarm limit. 5 Select OK. 7.1.5 Changing FHR Alarm Delay You can change the FHR alarm delay. The alarm delay indicates how long the measured result continues exceeding its limit before the alarm is triggered. 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Alarm > FHR > Alarm Delay. 3 Select a value from 0 ~ 20. 4 Select OK. The FHR alarm delay is adjustable between 0 and 20 seconds. 7.1.6 Testing US Transducers To test a US transducer: 1) Switch on the monitor. 2) Connect the US transducer to the fetal monitor. 3) Hold the transducer with one hand, and gently touch the center of the transducer with the other hand in the frequency of 2 times per second. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring Figure 7-2 Testing a US Transducer 4) Check that the value on the display shows this change in FHR. If a US transducer fails the test, repeat this test with another transducer. If the second one passes the test, defect of the first transducer is confirmed. Replace it with a good one. If the second transducer fails the test as well, contact the manufacturer for service. 7.2 Monitoring FHR with DECG 7.2.1 Contraindications The fetal spiral electrode can be used when amniotic membranes are adequately ruptured and sufficient cervical dilatation is ensured. The fetal electrode tip is designed to penetrate the epidermis of the fetus; therefore, trauma, hemorrhage and/or infection can occur. The electrode should be used with strict adherence to aseptic technique. The fetal spiral electrode should not be applied to the fetal face, fontanels or genitalia. Do not apply the fetal spiral electrode when placenta previa is present; when the mother has visible genital herpes lesions or reports symptoms of prodromal lesions; when the mother is HIV sero-positive; when mother is a confirmed carrier of hemophilia and the fetus is affected or of unknown status; or when it is not possible to identify fetal presenting part where application is being considered. This method is not recommended when fetus is extremely premature, or in the presence of a maternal infection such as Hepatitis B, Group B hemolytic strep, syphilis or gonorrhea, unless a clear benefit to the fetus or mother can be established. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 7.2.2 Parts Required 1) DECG cable 2) Fetal spiral electrode 3) Disposable maternal attachment pad electrode The following illustration shows how these parts should be connected: Figure 7-3 Connection for DECG Monitoring 7.2.3 Preparing Patient's Skin Prior to Placing Electrodes The skin is a poor conductor of electricity; therefore preparation of the patient's skin is important to facilitate good electrode contact to skin. 1) Shave hair from electrode sites, if necessary. 2) Wash the sites thoroughly with soap and water. (Do not use ether or pure alcohol, which will increase skin impPT. SINKO PRIMA ALLOYce) 3) Rub the skin briskly to increase capillary blood flow in the tissues. 4) Remove skin scurf and grease. 7.2.4 Changing DECG Beep Volume When the DECG beep is enabled, the monitor gives a beep sound of DECG. The frequency of DECG beep corresponds to the fetal heart rate, but occasionally it may differ due to weak DECG To change the DECG beep volume, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Fetus > DECG Beep. 3 Select 0 (default) ~ 9. 4 Select OK. Once the DECG beep volume is changed by selecting the volume adjustment key on the main interface and rotating the control knob, the sound switches to channel 1 automatically. Therefore, it is advised against changing DECG beep volume in the monitoring process. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 7.2.5 Switching the Artifact Suppression On or Off When monitoring FHR with DECG, artifacts may occur due to bad connection of the spiral electrode, excessive motion of the mother, electromyographic interference etc.. The Artifact Suppression feature is designed to eliminate the interference. When artifact suppression is on, artifacts are suppressed and not recorded. When it is off, the artifacts are shown as well as the fetal heartbeats. You can choose to switch the artifact suppression on or off. 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Fetus > Artifact Suppression. 3 Select ON (default) or OFF. 4 Select OK. When artifact suppression is on, fetal arrhythmia will also be suppressed. Therefore, if fetal arrhythmia is suspected, switch artifact suppression off. 7.2.6 DECG Monitoring Procedure 1 Perform a vaginal examination to identify the fetal presenting part. 2 Prepare the patient’s skin using the procedures described in section 7.2.3 Preparing the Patient's Skin Prior to Placing Electrodes. 3 Attach the fetal spiral electrode to the fetal presenting part using the procedures described on the package. 4 Fix an attachment pad electrode to DECG cable. 5 Remove the film on the back of the electrode and place the electrode on maternal thigh; press it firmly in place. 6 Connect the fetal spiral electrode to the DECG cable. 7 Insert connector of DECG cable into the DECG socket of the monitor. Do not plug the fetal spiral electrode wire into the power socket. Do not mistake the higher maternal heart rate for DECG. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 1 If there is any doubt as to the presence of a fetal heart signal with ECG, check with the US transducer on the patient’s abdomen or with a separate diagnostic instrument. The presence of an audible Doppler heart sound at a rate distinct from that of the maternal pulse is unequivocal evidence of the fetal life. 2 After the electrode is well attached, allow a few minutes for the electrode and fetal tissue to become stabilized. It is essential that the ECG signal electrode is in good contact with the fetal presenting part. 7.2.7 Detaching Fetal Spiral Electrode To detach the fetal spiral electrode, rotate it counterclockwise until it is free from the fetal presenting part. Do not pull the electrode from the fetal skin forcefully. Dispose of the used fetal spiral electrode in a proper way. Do not use it again. 7.3 Monitoring Twin FHRs 7.3.1 Monitoring Twins Externally To monitor twin FHRs externally, you need to connect a US transducer to US1 socket and the second US transducer to US2 socket of the monitor. Follow the instructions described in Section 7.1 Monitoring FHR with Ultrasound to acquire FHR signals for both channels. Press CHANNEL key to switch the fetal heart sound from one channel to the other. When the two US transducers are fixed, make sure fetal heart sounds from both channels are clear, two FHR traces and two FHR numerics are displayed on the screen. To ensure that both transducers stay at the optimum location, each transducer should be fixed with a separate belt. 7.3.2 Monitoring Internally Alternatively, you can monitor one fetal heart using ultrasound externally, and monitor the other fetal heart using DECG internally. Connect the US transducer to US2 socket; connect DECG cable to DECG socket. Monitor one twin with a US transducer using the procedures described in Section 7.1 Monitoring FHR with Ultrasound. Monitor the second twin with a DECG cable using the procedures described in Section 7.2 Monitoring FHR with DECG. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring The US transducer must be connected to US2 socket. If the US transducer connects to US1 socket while DECG cable is connected to DECG socket, the FHR trace and numeric from US1 will not be displayed. 7.3.3 Signals Overlap Verification (SOV) When monitoring twins, there are possibilities that one twin’s FHR signal is mistaken for the other one’s signal. The monitor provides signals overlap verification (SOV) function to reduce these possibilities. In the process of monitoring, if the SOV detects signals overlapping, an alarm message ―Signals Overlap (FHR1/DFHR, FHR2)‖ will appear on the screen to warn you. Checking the patient and reposition of transducers might be needed. 7.3.4 Changing FHR2 Offset In order to distinguish FHR1/DFHR trace from FHR2 trace, FHR2 offset is provided to help you separate the two traces by an offset of -20 bpm or +20 bpm. To change the FHR2 offset, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Recorder > FHR2 Offset. 3 Select -20 bpm (default), 0 bpm or +20bpm. 4 Select OK. This preset FHR2 offset will be printed on the recorder paper every 10 minutes. ―FHR2: -20bpm‖: the FHR2 trace is 20bpm lower than it really is. ―FHR2: 0bpm‖: the FHR2 trace is in its real position. ―FHR2: 20bpm‖: the FHR2 trace is 20bpm higher than it really is. 7.4 Monitoring Uterine Activity Externally 1 Inspect patient skin before applying the transducer for monitoring. If the skin quality is poor, especially when the skin is damaged or irritated, please change a site to apply the transducer. 2 During long-time monitoring, please inspect the application site (between contractions) of TOCO transducer at least every three hours. If the skin quality changes, you should move the transducer to another site. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 7.4.1 Parts Required 1) TOCO transducer 2) Belt 7.4.2 TOCO Monitoring Procedure 1) Placing Transducer Belt Place the transducer belts across the bed, ensuring that the belt will be around the abdomen when it is fastened. Lay the patient on the bed. Alternatively, the patient can take a sitting position. Arrange the belt around her abdomen. 2) Fixing the Transducer Wipe any gel remaining on abdomen around this area. Place the TOCO transducer on the patient’s abdomen, which is flat and approximately 3 cm away from the fundus, e.g. slightly above the umbilicus on the left or on the right. The position should be different for different purposes: place the transducer close to the fetal buttocks for NST, and place it on fetal back in delivery. Place the transducer on fetal buttocks for Place the transducer NST on fetal back in Figure 7-4 Positioning TOCO Transducer Wrap the abdomen with the belt over the transducer. Fix the transducer by pushing its buckle through the overlapping section of the belt. Make sure the belt fits the patient snugly and comfortably. 3) Adjusting the Numeric to Zero Press the AUTO ZERO key to adjust the numeric to the baseline. Make sure this is not done during a contraction. Wipe off any gel presents on abdomen around this area. 1 Do not apply aquasonic coupling gel on a TOCO transducer or its contact area. 2 Check the function of the TOCO transducer by applying pressure on it to see if this is displayed on the screen. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring 7.4.3 Changing UA Baseline You can change the UA baseline, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Fetus > UA Baseline. 3 Select 5, 10 (default), 15 or 20. 4 Select OK.

Figure 7-5 Testing a TOCO Transducer 4) Check that the value on the display shows this change in pressure. If a TOCO transducer fails the test, repeat this test with another transducer. If the second one passes the test, defect of the first transducer is confirmed. Replace it with a good one. If the second transducer fails the test as well, contact the manufacturer for service. 7.5 Monitoring Uterine Activity Internally 7.5.1 Parts Required 1) Disposable intrauterine pressure catheter ACCU-TRACE™ IUPC (―IUPC‖ for short) 2) Reusable intrauterine pressure cable (―IUP cable‖ for short) 3) Reusable intrauterine pressure connecting cable (―connecting cable‖ for short) SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring The following illustration shows how these parts should be connected: (1) (2) (3) Figure 7-6 Connection for IUP Monitoring 7.5.2 IUP Monitoring Procedure 1 Before insertion of IUPC, placental position should be confirmed, amniotic membranes are adequately ruptured and sufficient cervical dilatation is assured. 2 Try to insert the catheter opposite the placental site. Do not insert the introducer beyond the cervical OS. Use it with caution when uterine infection is present. 3 If resistance is met at any time during insertion, withdraw the catheter slightly and try at a different angle. Forced insertion may result in patient’s discomfort or injury. 1 Since procedures vary according to hospital needs/preferences, it is the responsibility of the hospital staff to determine exact policies and procedures for both monitoring and amnioinfusion. The safe and effective use of the IUPC depends on the skill of the clinician who applies /uses it. 2 The Product has been sterilized by gamma radiation and is sterilized and non- pyrogenic unless package is broken or open. Do not re-sterilize it. Follow the instruction on the package to check the cable function if its performance is in Procedures: 1) Insert IUPC using the procedures described on the package. 2) Plug the IUP cable to the TOCO/IUP socket of the monitor. 3) Momentarily pressing the re-zero button on the IUP cable. The green light on the cable will flash for five seconds. During this period, zero the monitor by pressing the AUTO ZERO key. Make sure the display numeric and trace are both ―0‖. 4) Connect the IUPC to the IUP cable. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Fetal Monitoring Figure 7-7 Connect catheter to pressure cable 5) Ask the mother to cough. A spike on the trace in response to the cough indicates proper positioning and function of the IUPC. 6) Wash timely during monitoring. A spike on the trace will respond to the washing. 7.6 Monitoring Fetal Movement Fetal movement situation derives from auto fetal movement (AFM) and manual fetal movement (MFM) monitoring. 7.6.1 Auto Fetal Movement Monitoring (AFM) During fetal heart monitoring with ultrasound, the fetal movement signals are also detected. The fetal movement signals differ from the Doppler heart rate signals in that they have larger extent and lower frequency. The larger extent is because of the bigger scope of moving areas (e.g., the fetal arms or legs); lower frequency is because of the lower velocity of the fetal movements compared with those of the fetal heart. Only US1 channel can perform AFM. But be aware that when monitoring twins, the movements detected by US1 may also be caused by the second fetus’s movement. The movement of the fetus will be detected and displayed in the form of a trace or blackmark on the screen and the recorder paper. AFM monitoring can be switched off. 7.6.2 Enabling or Disabling AFM Monitoring To enable or disable AFM monitoring, 1 Select the setup key on the main interface. 2 Select Fetus > AFM. 3 Select ON or OFF (default). 4 Select OK. 7.6.3 Choosing AFM Mode When AFM monitoring is enabled, the AFM monitoring result is displayed either in the form of a trace or black marks.

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual After Monitoring Chapter 9 After Monitoring 9.1 Saving Data The monitor automatically saves the data every two minutes and prior to shutdown, including fetal monitoring traces and maternal information. The maximum capacity is 60-hour data. When the monitor is switched on again, those data will be loaded. You can review them or print them at a high speed. Switch off the monitor in a normal way as described in section 9.3 Switching Off. Interrupted power-off may cause data loss and failure in data reloading. 9.2 Completing Monitoring After monitoring, 1) Remove transducers or electrodes from the patient; wipe the remaining gel off the patient and the transducer with a clean soft cloth or tissue. 2) Tear off the printed recorder paper. 1 The remaining coupling gel on the ultrasound transducer may cause the monitor to give some noise. Therefore, the gel should be wiped off the transducer after monitoring. 2 After the fetus is delivered in the labor, the monitor may pick up signals of the umbilical cord and display a trace/numeric. To avoid misinterpretation, it is recommended to remove the transducers from the patient and switch off the monitor immediately after the fetus is delivered. 9.3 Switching Off 1) Press and hold the POWER switch for at least 1 second to switch off the monitor. 2) Unplug the power cord. After the monitor is switched off, please wait for at least 10 seconds before switching it SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Maintenance and Cleaning ",

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Maintenance and Cleaning 10.1.2 Maintenance of Monitor Keep the exterior surface of the monitor clean, free of dust and dirt. The gathering of dew on the screen may occur with abrupt temperature or humidity changes. A table environment is recommended. Avoid scratching and damaging the screen. 10.1.3 Maintenance of Transducers 1 The transducers must be cleaned before docking in the base station after each use. Make sure that there is no residual coupling gel. 2 The transducers are delicate and sensitive. Please handle them with care and try to avoid dropping on to the ground or any hard surfaces. Gel must be wiped off the US transducer after use. These precautions will prolong the life of the transducer. Avoid contacting the transducers with hard or sharp objects. Although transducers are designed for durability, they should be handled with care. Rough handling could damage the cover, piezoelectric crystals and mechanical movement. Do not excessively flex the cables. 10.1.4 Storage of Recorder Paper The thermosensitive recorder paper is not intended to be used as a long-term storage medium. We recommend you to save the monitoring data with another medium. When storing recorder paper (including used paper with traces): Do not store in plastic envelopes. Do not leave exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light. Do not exceed a storage temperature of +40 ºC (+104 ºF). Do not exceed a relative humidity of 80%. Storage conditions outside these limits may distort the paper and adversely affect the accuracy of grid lines or make the trace unreadable. 10.1.5 Maintenance of Recorder Switch off the monitor and remove the power cord prior to recorder cleaning. The recorder platen, thermal print head and paper sensing mechanism must be cleaned at least SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Maintenance and Cleaning once a year or when needed (when traces become faint).

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety Appendix 4 Ultrasound Intensity and Safety A4.1Ultrasound in Medicine The use of diagnostic ultrasound has proved to be a valuable tool in medical practice. Given its known benefits for non-invasive investigations and medical diagnosis, including investigation of the human fetus, the question of clinical safety with regards to ultrasound intensity arises. There is no easy answer to the question of safety surrounding the use of diagnostic ultrasound equipment. Application of the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle serves as a rule-of-thumb that will help you to get reasonable results with the lowest possible ultrasonic The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) states that given its track record of over 25 years of use and no confirmed biological effects on patients or instrument operators, the benefits of the prudent use of diagnostic ultrasound clearly outweigh any risks. A4.2Ultrasound Safety and the ALARA Principle Ultrasound waves dissipate energy in the form of heat and can therefore cause tissue warming. Although this effect is extremely low with Doppler, it is important to know how to control and limit patient exposure. Major governing bodies in ultrasound have issued statements to the effect that there are no known adverse effects from the use of diagnostic ultrasound, however, exposure levels should always be limited to As Low As Reasonably Achievable (the ALARA principle). A4.3Explanation of MI/TI A4.3.1MI (Mechanical Index) Cavitations will be generated when ultrasound wave passes through and contacts tissues, resulting in instantaneous local overheating. This phenomenon is determined by acoustic pressure, spectrum, focus, transmission mode, and factors such as states and properties of the tissue and boundary. This mechanical bioeffect is a threshold phenomenon that occurs when a certain level of ultrasound output is exceeded. The threshold is related to the type of tissue. Although no confirmed adverse mechanical effects on patients or mammals caused by exposure at intensities typical of present diagnostic ultrasound instruments have ever been reported, the threshold for cavitation is still undetermined. Generally speaking, the higher the acoustic pressure, the greater the potential for mechanical bioeffects; the lower the acoustic frequency, the greater the potential for mechanical bioeffects. The AIUM and NEMA formulate mechanical index (MI) in order to indicate the potential for mechanical effects. The MI is defined as the ratio of the peak-rarefactional acoustic pressure (should be calculated by tissue acoustic attenuation coefficient 0.3dB/cm/MHz) to the acoustic frequency. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety MI = Pr, α CMI = 1 (MPa / MHz ) A4.3.2TI (Thermal Index) Heating of tissues is caused by absorption of ultrasound when the ultrasound energy is applied. The temperature rise is determined by the acoustic intensity, exposed area and thermophysical properties of the tissue. In order to indicate the potential for temperature rise caused by thermal effects, the AIUM and NEMA formulate thermal index (TI). It is defined as the ratio of the total acoustic power to the acoustic power required to raise the tissue temperature by 1ºC. According to different thermophysical properties of the tissue, TI is divided into three kinds: TIS, TIB and TIC. TIS (Soft Tissue Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise in soft or similar tissues. TIB (Bone Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise when the ultrasound beam passes through soft tissue and a focal region is in the immediate vicinity of bone. TIC (Cranial Bone Thermal Index): It provides an estimate of potential temperature rise in the cranial bones or superficial bones. A4.3.3Measurement Uncertainty The uncertainties in the measurements were predominantly systematic in origin; the random uncertainties were negligible in comparison. The overall systematic uncertainties were determined as follows. 1. Hydrophone Sensitivity Based on the HNP-0400 hydrophone calibration certificate, the hydrophone measurement uncertainty for 1-15MHz is 1 dB, which is equivalent to an uncertainty of ±12.20% for intensity and ±6.10% for pressure. This uncertainty is used in PW measurement uncertainty assessment. 2. Digitizer Based on the oscilloscope calibration certificate, the oscilloscope uncertainty is ±1.16% for intensity and ±0.58% for pressure. 3. Temperature Based on the temperature variation of the water bath and the difference in mean temperatures between the hydrophone calibration lab and our facility, the uncertainty is ±1.6% for intensity and ±0.8% for pressure. 4. Spatial Averaging The maximum spatial averaging correction factor in this submission is reported as 1.17 for HNP- 0400 hydrophone. According to [6], the uncertainty is assumed to be one-half of the value of the correction value; therefore the uncertainty for spatial averaging is ±10.2% for intensity and ±6.1% for pressure for the HNP-0400 hydrophone. 5. Non-linear Distortion: 6. Total Uncertainty for HNP-0400 Hydrophone Since all the above error sources are independent, they may be added on an root sum square basis, giving a total uncertainty of ±26.62% for all intensity values reported, and ±13.31% for all the pressure values. Since the total power is based on the intensity, the uncertainty for power is also ±26.62% . The center frequency estimate is depended upon the digital oscilloscope and is therefore given as SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Ultrasound Intensity and Safety Since the MI is based on the pressure and the square root of the center frequency, the uncertainty for the MI is therefore reported as±14.52% . A4.4Prudent Use Statement Although no confirmed bioeffects on patients caused by exposure from present diagnostic ultrasound equipment have ever been reported, the potential exists that such bioeffects may be identified in the future. Therefore, the ultrasound should be used prudently. High levels of acoustic output and long exposure time should be avoided while acquiring necessary clinical information.

SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Limitations of Ultrasonic Monitoring Appendix 8 Limitations of Ultrasonic Monitoring A8.1 How Does Ultrasound Work When the ultrasound waves strike an object, they bounce back and create an echo. If the object moves toward the sound source, the frequency of the echo increases. If the object moves away from the sound source, the frequency of the echo decreases. This is called ―Doppler Effect‖. In the 1960's, the ultrasonic technique was first applied to medical diagnostic imaging. The ultrasound process involves placing a small device called a transducer, against the skin of the patient near the region of interest. The ultrasound transducer combines functions of emitting and receiving ultrasounds in one device. This transducer produces a stream of inaudible, high frequency sound waves which penetrate into the body and bounce off the organs inside. It detects sound waves as they bounce off or echo back from the internal structures and contours of the organs. The movement of the organs produces the Doppler Effect, and this movement can be measured and described by measuring the echo. In fetal monitoring, the ultrasound transducer produces a stream of sound waves which penetrate into the maternal abdomen and bounce off the fetal heart. Then the transducer receives the echoes and transfers them to the monitor, which turns the signal into fetal heart beating sound and fetal heart rate trace. Therefore, placement of the transducer is critical to ultrasound fetal heart monitoring. A8.2 Artifacts in Fetal Heart Monitoring (1) How does artifact happen? The transducer detects sound waves as they bounce off or echo back from the fetal heart. However, the sound waves bouncing off from maternal blood vessels may be detected by the transducer and then be processed by the monitor as well. As a result, artifacts may be produced. The artifacts, if not correctly interpreted, may cause the physicians to perform unnecessary interventions, or to fail to detect the fetal distress and the need for interventions. The most common artifacts are doubling and halving. (2) Doubling: When the FHR drops to 120 bpm or lower, the diastole and systole become far apart, thereby the monitor may mistake these two movements of a single heartbeat for two separate heartbeats. As a result, a heart rate trace that is double the actual heart rate is produced. This often happens during severe decelerations and bradycardia, representing an abrupt switch of the trace to double the actual heart rate. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Limitations of Ultrasonic Monitoring (3) Halving: When the FHR increases to 180 bpm or higher, it is possible for the monitor to mistake the two separate hearbeats for the diastole and systole of a single heartbeat. As a result, a heart rate trace that is half the actual heart rate is produced. This often happens during tachycardia, representing an abrupt switch of the trace to half the actual heart rate. The clinicians may interpret it as a ―deceleration‖. However, the heart beat sound from the monitor speaker is still reliable even when doubling or halving is occurring. SONOTRAX MED-01 Fetal Monitor User Manual Limitations of Ultrasonic Monitoring Stethoscopy should be applied when sudden changes in baseline are detected. If the amniotic membrane rupture and cervical dilatation are sufficient, consider using a spiral electrode to obtain precise FHR with direct fetal ECG as the signal source. (4) Erratic Traces / Drop out When the fetal heart moves partially out of the ultrasound wave path, the transducer receives mixed or weak signals, and thereby the monitor presents erratic traces. When the fetal heart moves fully out of the path, inadequate consecutive and periodic signals are received, and no trace is represented. Erratic traces and transitory episodes of drop out are common, especially when the fetus or/and mother move(s). If they exist for an extended period, it indicates that the transducer is not aimed at the fetus. Repositioning of the transducer is needed. A8.3 Audio Output and Screen Reading In most instances, the audio output from the monitor speaker corresponds to the readings presented on the monitor screen. But occasionally the fetal heart sound may differ from the trace and numeric. When the fetal heart moves partially out of the ultrasound wave path, the transducer receives weaker FHR signal and other stronger signals (usually maternal heart/pulse rate). After the signals are transmitted to the monitor, the audio system and the video system of the monitor process the signals separately. On one hand, the audio circuit filters the low-frequency signals and gives audio output of the high-frequency signals, so fetal heart sound is heard. On the other hand, the autocorrelation algorithm computes the stronger signal source and thereby the maternal heart/pulse rate is displayed. As a result, the audio output differs from the screen reading. If this situation occurs, it can be dismissed by repositioning the transducer. In a word, the abnormalities listed above (artifacts, sound and reading differences) are caused by the limitations of ultrasonic monitoring technique. Fortunately they rarely occur. But a good understanding of how to detect them and what countermeasures should be taken will help obtain better fetal monitoring effect. We hope you find this information useful.
